# World Simulator - Game Rules & Mechanics (Updated December 2024)

## üåç **World Generation**

### **Tile System**
- **Tile Size**: 16x16 pixels
- **Chunk System**: 16x16 tiles per chunk for efficient loading
- **Procedural Generation**: Uses simplex noise with configurable seeds
- **Grid Alignment**: Perfect tile grid with 1px black borders

### **Three-Layer Tile Rendering**
Each tile consists of three distinct visual layers rendered in order:

1. **Base Color Layer** (Bottom)
   - Solid color square representing the tile type (GRASS, WATER, etc.)
   - 14x14 pixels with 1px black border gap
   - Used for quick terrain identification

2. **Background Sprite Layer** (Middle)
   - Textured sprite overlay for visual detail (e.g., grass variants, water textures)
   - 16x16 pixel sprites from sprite sheets (TexturedGrass.png, Shore.png)
   - Optional - not all tile types have background sprites
   - GRASS tiles have 6 variants mapped deterministically by coordinates
   - FOREST tiles also use textured grass variants for enhanced visual appeal

3. **Occupied Entity Layer** (Top)
   - Interactive game objects (NPCs, POIs, structures)
   - Animated sprites (animals, windmills, trees)
   - Only one entity per tile allowed
   - Rendered on top with proper collision detection

### **Tile Data Structure**
```typescript
interface Tile {
  // Base tile properties
  x: number;
  y: number;
  value: TileType;           // GRASS, WATER, etc. (determines base color)
  prevValue?: TileType;      // For player movement tracking
  interacted?: boolean;      // For player interaction state
  height: number;            // Elevation for world generation
  temperature: number;       // Climate data
  humidity: number;          // Climate data
  riverValue?: number;       // Water flow data
  flowDirection?: number;    // Water flow direction
  spriteId?: string;         // Background sprite path (e.g., TexturedGrass.png#1,0)
  dirtTimer?: number;        // For DIRT -> GRASS regeneration

  // Occupied entities (only one type per tile)
  trees?: Tree[];            // Animated tree structures
  cactus?: Cactus[];         // Animated cactus structures
  villageStructures?: VillageStructure[]; // Village POIs and NPCs
}
```

### **DIRT Tile Regeneration**
- **Creation**: DIRT tiles are created when trees are destroyed
- **Regeneration Time**: 30 seconds to convert back to GRASS
- **Appearance**: Light brown color (#CD853F) distinguishes from MUD
- **Purpose**: Temporary tile type showing environmental recovery

### **Biome Generation**
The world generates based on three noise layers:

1. **Height Map** (elevation)
2. **Temperature Map** (climate zones)
3. **Humidity Map** (moisture levels)

### **Biome Distribution**
Generated based on temperature and humidity:

**Cold Regions (temp < 0.2)**:
- High elevation: SNOW ‚Üí STONE ‚Üí COBBLESTONE (enhanced snow coverage at height > 0.75)
- High humidity: FOREST
- Low humidity: GRASS ‚Üí STONE

**Temperate Regions (0.4 < temp < 0.7)**:
- High elevation: SNOW ‚Üí STONE ‚Üí COBBLESTONE (enhanced snow coverage at height > 0.65)
- High humidity: FOREST ‚Üí GRASS
- Near water: CLAY/MUD mix
- Low humidity: SAND

**Hot Regions (temp > 0.7)**:
- High elevation: STONE ‚Üí COBBLESTONE
- High humidity: GRASS
- Low humidity: SAND (70% chance)

### **Background Sprite System**
- **Grass Variants**: 6 different TexturedGrass.png variants (0-5) mapped to 3√ó2 grid
- **Forest Background**: FOREST tiles use the same textured grass variants for enhanced visual depth
- **Water Tiles**: Shore.png sprites for shallow/deep water (variants 2 and 4)
- **Sand Tiles**: Shore.png sprite for sand (variant 0)
- **Automatic Assignment**: Tiles automatically get sprite IDs based on coordinates
- **Deterministic Mapping**: Same coordinates always get same grass variant
- **Performance**: Background sprites render behind all entities

## üö∂ **Movement System**

### **Basic Movement**
- **Controls**: WASD or Arrow Keys
- **Grid-Based**: Player moves one tile at a time
- **Tile Snapping**: Player position snaps to tile centers
- **Cooldown**: 120ms between moves when holding keys

### **Movement Rules**
- **Impassable Tiles**: Cannot move to DEEP_WATER, SHALLOW_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, or SNOW
- **Living Structure Blocking**: Cannot move to tiles with alive trees (health > 0)
- **Cactus Collision System**: Living cactus (health > 0) are impassable and cause bounce-back
  - **Damage**: 5 HP damage when attempting to move onto cactus
  - **Bounce-back**: Entity remains at previous position, movement blocked
  - **Cooldown**: 1-second damage immunity prevents repeated damage
  - **All Entities**: Affects player, NPCs, animals, traders, and monsters
- **Destroyed Structure Passage**: Can move through destroyed structures (health ‚â§ 0)
- **Mud Restriction**: Only 1/3 chance to move when standing on MUD
- **Village Structure Blocking**: Cannot move to tiles with non-passable POIs (wells, markets, windmills, entrances) or living NPCs
- **UI Movement Restrictions**: Arrow keys disabled for player movement when inventory UI is open
  - **Other UI Types**: Text box and tombstone UI also pause movement through game logic pause
  - **Directional Updates**: Player facing direction still updates when UI is open
  - **Action Blocking**: Attack and interact actions disabled during UI display

### **Direction Tracking**
- **Facing Direction**: Always updated when movement keys pressed (even if blocked)
- **Facing Tile Logging**: Shows tile info including structure health
- **Movement Blocking**: Logs which tile type prevented movement

### **Camera System**

- **Slowed Movement Cooldown**: 1.2 seconds between normal moves (reduced from 0.6s for more realistic pacing)
- **Quick Retry**: 0.3 seconds retry when blocked (reduced from 0.6s)
- **High Activity**: 80% chance to attempt movement each cycle for active animals
- **Anti-Stuck Mechanism**: Force movement after 5 seconds of inactivity
- **Reduced Spacing Restrictions**: 40% avoidance of adjacent tiles (down from 70%)
- **Staggered Timing**: Random initial delays prevent synchronized movement
- **Movement Tracking**: System monitors and prevents prolonged idle periods
- **Direction Consistency**: NPCs only change facing direction when actually moving to new tiles
- **Tile Validation**: Movement only occurs when successfully changing tile coordinates
- **Negative Coordinate Support**: Fixed coordinate calculation issues for animals in negative tile positions
- **Player Collision Prevention**: NPCs cannot move to tiles occupied by the player
- **Deadlock Resolution System**: Two-phase movement with speculative coordination to prevent clustering deadlocks
  - **Movement Intention Collection**: All NPCs declare intended movements before any actual movement
  - **Coordinated Swapping**: Animals can swap positions when both want each other's tiles
  - **Chain Movement**: If one animal wants to move away, others can coordinate to take their place
  - **Deterministic Behavior**: Movement decisions cached for 100ms to ensure consistent intention-execution matching
  - **Escape Mechanism**: Long-stuck animals (8+ seconds) get increased randomness to break deadlocks

## üíÄ **Death & Tombstone System**

### **Entity Death Mechanics**
- **Player Death**: When player health ‚â§ 0
  - Creates tombstone at death location with player's complete 9-slot inventory
  - Player respawns at world origin (0,0) with full health and empty inventory
  - Player must retrieve items from tombstone by interacting with it
- **Animal Death** (chicken, pig, sheep): When killed by player
  - Inventory items automatically transferred to player inventory
  - No tombstone created (animals consumed immediately)
- **Trader/Monster Death**: When health ‚â§ 0
  - Creates tombstone with NPC's 9-slot inventory
  - Tombstone becomes interactable POI on the tile
  - Original NPC removed from world

### **Tombstone Interaction System**

- **Final Stage**: Trees stop growing at FULL stage
- **Real-Time**: Growth continues based on game time

### **Tree Destruction**
- **Broken Stumps**: Destroyed trees become CUT_DOWN stage (sprite index 0)
- **Passable**: Broken stumps allow player movement through them
- **Visual Persistence**: Stumps remain visible on tile
- **No Removal**: Trees remain as stumps, don't disappear

## üåµ **Cactus Growth System**

### **Cactus Variants & Growth Stages**
| Variant | Growth Sequence | Description | Health |

- **Village Grid Areas**: 50x50 tile grid areas (800x800 pixels) - only one village per grid area
- **Village Center Selection**: Within each qualifying grid area, the tile with highest village noise value (>0.85 threshold) is selected as village center
- **Biome Restriction**: Villages only spawn on GRASS tiles
- **One Entity Per Tile**: Strict enforcement prevents multiple structures on same tile
- **Deterministic Placement**: Same seed always generates villages in same locations

### **Well-Centered Village Layout**
| Structure | Position | Spawn Rate | Requirements |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Water Well** | Village center (best noise tile in grid area) | 1 per grid area | GRASS tile, interactable (restores 25 health) |
| **Windmill** | Randomly placed 6-10 tiles from well | 1 per village | Valid terrain (not water/stone), animated (2-second cycle) |
| **Food Market** | Randomly placed 6-10 tiles from well | 1 per village | Valid terrain (not water/stone) |

1. **Grid Area Evaluation**: Each 50x50 tile area is evaluated for village potential
2. **Best Tile Selection**: Within qualifying areas, the tile with highest village noise value becomes village center
3. **Well Placement**: Single water well placed at selected center tile
4. **POI Structure Distribution**: Windmill and markets placed randomly in 6-10 tile radius from well
5. **Animal Placement**: Village animals placed randomly in 12-15 tile radius from well during tile-by-tile generation
6. **Conflict Prevention**: Each tile is processed individually, ensuring POI structures take precedence over NPCs
7. **Area Marking**: Grid area marked as occupied to prevent duplicate villages

### **Biome Restrictions for Structures**
- **POI Structures** (wells, windmills, markets): Cannot be placed on DEEP_WATER, SHALLOW_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, or SNOW tiles
- **NPC Animals**: Cannot be placed on DEEP_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, SNOW, or SHALLOW_WATER tiles

### **Village Structure Spacing Requirements**
- **POI Structure Spacing**: Minimum 2-tile spacing radius between all POI structures (wells, windmills, markets)
- **Spacing Validation**: System prevents placement of POI structures too close to existing POI structures
- **Animal Spacing**: Minimum 2-tile spacing radius between all NPCs for adequate movement space
- **Priority System**: POI structures take precedence over NPCs during village generation

### **NPC Movement & AI**
- **Detection Range**: 5 tiles radius
- **Wheat Attraction**: Animals follow players with wheat in inventory (5-tile radius)
- **Dynamic Same-Type Attraction**: Variable attraction rates (6-40%) based on local animal density
- **Tile-Based Movement**: NPCs move one tile at a time with 1.2-second cooldowns (slowed for realism)
- **Movement Logic**: Direction-based movement towards/away from targets
- **Flexible Spacing**: Animals can move adjacent to each other, only avoiding overcrowded tiles (2+ neighbors)
- **Collision Avoidance**: NPCs avoid tiles occupied by other NPCs
- **Terrain Restrictions**: NPCs cannot move onto DEEP_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, SNOW, or SHALLOW_WATER tiles
- **Personal Space System**: Animals actively escape when surrounded by 3+ same-type animals
- **Exploration Behavior**: 25% chance for random exploration overriding attraction

- **Continuous Updates**: NPCs updated every frame for smooth movement and animation
- **Reduced Logging**: Only logs successful movements and important errors to avoid console spam

#### **Trader-Specific Flocking Behavior**
Trader NPCs implement specialized flocking AI distinct from animal behavior:
- **Village Structure Attraction**: Actively move towards nearby village buildings within 5-tile detection range
  - **Primary Targets**: Water wells, markets, windmills, notice boards
  - **Attraction Strength**: Similar to animal wheat-following but for structures
- **Monster Avoidance**: Flee from hostile monsters (orcs, goblins, skeletons, slimes) within detection range
  - **Avoidance Priority**: Monster avoidance overrides structure attraction
  - **Flee Distance**: Move away from monsters until outside detection range
- **Player Neutrality**: Traders do NOT follow or avoid players unless attacked
  - **No Wheat Response**: Unlike animals, traders ignore players carrying wheat
  - **Combat Response**: Only flee from player if attacked (enters 'fleeing' state)
- **Trader Clustering**: Traders avoid crowding around same structures
  - **Spacing**: Maintain 2+ tile minimum distance from other NPCs
  - **Structure Distribution**: Multiple traders spread across different village buildings

### **Tile-Based Movement Rules**
- **One Entity Per Tile**: Only one structure, POI, or NPC can occupy a single tile at any time
- **Collision Detection**: NPCs check tile availability before moving to new positions
- **Spacing Preferences**: Animals and friendly NPCs prefer tiles that maintain 1-tile spacing from other NPCs
- **Fallback Movement**: If no spaced tiles available, NPCs fall back to basic collision avoidance
- **Movement Blocking**: NPCs cannot move to tiles occupied by:
  - Living trees or cactus (health > 0)
  - Impassable POIs (markets, windmills, chests)
  - Other living NPCs
  - Impassable terrain (DEEP_WATER, SHALLOW_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, SNOW)
- **Direction Updates**: NPC facing direction is updated before moving to new tile
- **Movement Validation**: If target tile is occupied, NPC velocity is reduced to prevent jittering
- **Chunk-Based Tracking**: NPC positions are tracked per chunk for efficient collision detection

### **Animal Breeding System**
- **Breeding Conditions**: Two animals of the same species must be adjacent and facing each other
- **Species Compatibility**: Only identical animal types can breed (chicken + chicken, pig + pig, sheep + sheep)
- **Breeding Cooldown**: 30-second cooldown between breeding attempts per animal
- **Facing Requirement**: Both animals must be facing directly towards each other
- **Offspring Placement**: New animals spawn in adjacent tiles near the parents
- **Real-Time Breeding**: Breeding attempts occur during normal game updates
- **Breeding Success**: Successful breeding creates a new NPC of the same type with full health
- **Breeding Failure**: If no suitable adjacent tile is available, breeding fails but animals can try again after cooldown
- **Population Growth**: Allows for dynamic animal population expansion in villages and wild areas
- **Visual Feedback**: Console logs successful breeding events with parent locations
- **World System Integration**: Breeding requests are handled by the World system for proper entity management

### **Animation System for NPCs**
- **Directional Sprites**: 4 directions (up, down, left, right)
- **Walking Animation**: 4 frames per direction, 1-second cycle
- **Direction Updates**: Direction changes based on movement
- **Animation Timing**: Frame updates tied to game loop deltaTime

## üèóÔ∏è **Current Architecture & Future Optimization Opportunities**

### **Current System Architecture**
The game follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

#### **Core Systems**
- **Game Engine** (`src/game/engine/`): Main game loop, state management, and core game logic
- **World Management** (`src/game/world/`): Procedural world generation, chunk management, and dungeon systems
- **Entity System** (`src/game/entities/`): Player, NPCs, structures, POIs, and inventory management
- **UI System** (`src/game/ui/`): User interface components, inventory UIs, and visual feedback
- **Input/Action Systems** (`src/game/systems/`): Input processing, movement, animation, and game actions
- **Translation System** (`src/game/translations/`): Localized text and entity interaction messages
- **Asset Management** (`src/game/assets/`): Sprite mapping, asset loading, and resource management

#### **Current Design Patterns**
- **Observer Pattern**: Camera and UI systems observe player state changes
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different movement strategies for world vs dungeon environments
- **Factory Pattern**: Entity creation through chunk generation and world systems
- **Singleton Pattern**: Global systems like AnimationSystem and Camera
- **Component Pattern**: Entities composed of position, health, inventory, and behavior components

### **Identified Optimization Opportunities**

#### **1. Entity Component System (ECS) Architecture**
**Current State**: Entities use inheritance-based architecture with mixed responsibilities
**Optimization**: Implement ECS pattern for better performance and maintainability
```typescript
// Proposed ECS Structure
interface Component {}
interface PositionComponent extends Component { x: number; y: number; }
interface HealthComponent extends Component { health: number; maxHealth: number; }
interface InventoryComponent extends Component { items: InventoryItem[]; }
interface RenderComponent extends Component { sprite: Sprite; animation: AnimationData; }

class Entity {
  private components = new Map<ComponentType, Component>();
  addComponent<T extends Component>(component: T): void;
  getComponent<T extends Component>(type: ComponentType): T | null;
}

class System {
  abstract update(entities: Entity[], deltaTime: number): void;
}
```

#### **2. Service Locator Pattern**
**Current State**: Direct dependencies between systems create tight coupling
**Optimization**: Implement service locator for better dependency management
```typescript
class ServiceLocator {
  private static services = new Map<string, any>();

  static register<T>(name: string, service: T): void;
  static get<T>(name: string): T;
}

// Usage
ServiceLocator.register('worldGenerator', new WorldGenerator());
ServiceLocator.register('animationSystem', new AnimationSystem());
```

#### **3. Command Pattern for Actions**
**Current State**: Actions processed directly in ActionSystem
**Optimization**: Implement command pattern for undo/redo and action queuing
```typescript
interface Command {
  execute(): void;
  undo(): void;
}

class MoveCommand implements Command {
  constructor(private entity: Entity, private direction: Direction) {}
  execute(): void { /* move logic */ }
  undo(): void { /* reverse move */ }
}

class CommandManager {
  private history: Command[] = [];
  executeCommand(command: Command): void;
  undo(): void;
  redo(): void;
}
```

#### **4. Object Pool Pattern**
**Current State**: Entities created/destroyed frequently causing GC pressure
**Optimization**: Implement object pooling for frequently created entities
```typescript
class EntityPool<T> {
  private available: T[] = [];
  private inUse = new Set<T>();

  acquire(): T;
  release(entity: T): void;
  preAllocate(count: number): void;
}
```

#### **5. State Machine for Entity Behavior**
**Current State**: Entity behavior scattered across update methods
**Optimization**: Implement state machines for cleaner behavior management
```typescript
interface State {
  enter(entity: Entity): void;
  update(entity: Entity, deltaTime: number): void;
  exit(entity: Entity): void;
}

class StateMachine {
  private currentState: State;
  private states = new Map<string, State>();

  transition(stateName: string): void;
  update(entity: Entity, deltaTime: number): void;
}
```

#### **6. Event System for Decoupled Communication**
**Current State**: Direct method calls between systems create coupling
**Optimization**: Implement event system for loose coupling
```typescript
interface GameEvent {
  type: string;
  data?: any;
}

class EventBus {
  private listeners = new Map<string, Function[]>();

  subscribe(eventType: string, callback: Function): void;
  emit(event: GameEvent): void;
  unsubscribe(eventType: string, callback: Function): void;
}
```

### **Performance Optimization Recommendations**

#### **1. Spatial Indexing**
- Implement quadtree or spatial hash for efficient collision detection
- Reduce O(n¬≤) entity-to-entity checks to O(log n) or O(1)

#### **2. Chunk-Based Entity Management**
- Only update entities in active chunks (camera view + buffer)
- Implement entity hibernation for distant chunks

#### **3. Asset Streaming**
- Lazy load sprites and assets based on camera proximity
- Implement asset unloading for memory management

#### **4. Batch Rendering**
- Group similar sprites for batch rendering calls
- Reduce canvas context state changes

### **Maintainability Improvements**

#### **1. Configuration System**
- Centralize game constants and tuning parameters
- Support runtime configuration changes for balancing

#### **2. Plugin Architecture**
- Modular system for adding new features
- Hot-swappable components for development

#### **3. Testing Framework**
- Unit tests for core game logic
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Performance benchmarking suite

*This document reflects the current game implementation as a comprehensive survival/RPG experience with procedural world generation, well-centered village systems, animated NPCs, and advanced interaction systems. The game features a complete inventory system with redesigned full-width UI containers, enhanced equipment/armor slot management with two-column layout, and character viewing capabilities with continuously animated player sprites. The sophisticated combat mechanics include blocking systems, village-based reputation system with RPG dialogue, advanced monster flocking algorithms with two-phase movement coordination, enhanced dungeon systems with increased monster frequency and expanded NPC movement spaces, trader generation with defensive combat capabilities, dungeon monster spawning, environmental interactions with priority-based structure placement, modern bubble-style UI system with hierarchical component architecture inspired by contemporary mobile and handheld gaming interfaces, and comprehensive movement intention systems that prevent NPC deadlocks through speculative movement and position swapping. The enhanced inventory UI system provides optimal space utilization through height-aware slot sizing, armor slot management in a two-column layout, and trade inventory interfaces that use the full canvas width with 4-directional navigation, while automatically hiding the right-side inventory panel when full UI components are active. The enhanced dungeon system provides substantially more movement space for NPCs through expanded tunnel generation with increased width thresholds, room systems, and connecting corridors, while the advanced collision detection ensures smooth coordination between NPCs in both world and dungeon environments. The atomic OOP architecture with InputSystem and ActionSystem classes provides clean separation of concerns, type-safe action processing, and optimized game loop performance. The attack and interaction systems provide dynamic gameplay where player actions have meaningful consequences through the reputation system, while monsters actively hunt friendly NPCs using sophisticated AI behaviors with auto-blocking trader defensive combat and increased encounter frequency.*
