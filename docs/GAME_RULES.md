# World Simulator - Game Rules & Mechanics (Updated)

## üåç **World Generation**

### **Tile System**
- **Tile Size**: 16x16 pixels
- **Chunk System**: 16x16 tiles per chunk for efficient loading
- **Procedural Generation**: Uses simplex noise with configurable seeds
- **Grid Alignment**: Perfect tile grid with 1px black borders

### **Three-Layer Tile Rendering**
Each tile consists of three distinct visual layers rendered in order:

1. **Base Color Layer** (Bottom)
   - Solid color square representing the tile type (GRASS, WATER, etc.)
   - 14x14 pixels with 1px black border gap
   - Used for quick terrain identification

2. **Background Sprite Layer** (Middle)
   - Textured sprite overlay for visual detail (e.g., grass variants, water textures)
   - 16x16 pixel sprites from sprite sheets (TexturedGrass.png, Shore.png)
   - Optional - not all tile types have background sprites
   - GRASS tiles have 6 variants mapped deterministically by coordinates

3. **Occupied Entity Layer** (Top)
   - Interactive game objects (NPCs, POIs, structures)
   - Animated sprites (animals, windmills, trees)
   - Only one entity per tile allowed
   - Rendered on top with proper collision detection

### **Tile Data Structure**
```typescript
interface Tile {
  // Base tile properties
  value: TileType;           // GRASS, WATER, etc. (determines base color)
  spriteId?: string;         // Background sprite path (e.g., TexturedGrass.png#1,0)

  // Occupied entities (only one type per tile)
  trees?: Tree[];            // Animated tree structures
  cactus?: Cactus[];         // Animated cactus structures
  villageStructures?: {      // Village POIs and NPCs
    poi?: POI;               // Buildings, chests, etc.
    npc?: NPC;               // Animals, traders, monsters
  }[];
}
```

### **Tile Types**

|-----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| `DEEP_WATER` | Deep ocean/lakes | ‚ùå Impassable | Dark Blue (#00008B) |
| `SHALLOW_WATER` | Shallow water | ‚ö†Ô∏è Restricted (1/3 chance) | Blue (#4169E1) |
| `RIVER` | Flowing water | ‚úÖ Passable | Light Blue (#1E90FF) |
| `SAND` | Desert/beach sand | ‚úÖ Passable | Sandy (#F4A460) |
| `GRASS` | Grasslands | ‚úÖ Passable | Light Green (#90EE90) |
| `MUD` | Muddy terrain | ‚ö†Ô∏è Restricted (1/3 chance) | Dark Brown (#8B4513) |
| `DIRT` | Exposed soil | ‚úÖ Passable | Light Brown (#CD853F) |

### **DIRT Tile Regeneration**
- **Creation**: DIRT tiles are created when trees are destroyed
- **Regeneration Time**: 30 seconds to convert back to GRASS
- **Appearance**: Light brown color (#CD853F) distinguishes from MUD
- **Purpose**: Temporary tile type showing environmental recovery

### **Biome Generation**
The world generates based on three noise layers:

1. **Height Map** (elevation)
2. **Temperature Map** (climate zones)
3. **Humidity Map** (moisture levels)

### **Biome Distribution**
Generated based on temperature and humidity:

**Cold Regions (temp < 0.2)**:
- High elevation: SNOW ‚Üí STONE ‚Üí COBBLESTONE
- High humidity: FOREST
- Low humidity: GRASS ‚Üí STONE

**Temperate Regions (0.4 < temp < 0.7)**:
- High elevation: STONE ‚Üí COBBLESTONE
- High humidity: FOREST ‚Üí GRASS
- Near water: CLAY/MUD mix
- Low humidity: SAND

**Hot Regions (temp > 0.7)**:
- High elevation: STONE ‚Üí COBBLESTONE
- High humidity: GRASS
- Low humidity: SAND (70% chance)

### **Background Sprite System**
- **Grass Variants**: 6 different TexturedGrass.png variants (0-5) mapped to 3√ó2 grid
- **Water Tiles**: Shore.png sprites for shallow/deep water (variants 2 and 4)
- **Sand Tiles**: Shore.png sprite for sand (variant 0)
- **Automatic Assignment**: Tiles automatically get sprite IDs based on coordinates
- **Deterministic Mapping**: Same coordinates always get same grass variant
- **Performance**: Background sprites render behind all entities

## üö∂ **Movement System**

### **Basic Movement**
- **Controls**: WASD or Arrow Keys
- **Grid-Based**: Player moves one tile at a time
- **Tile Snapping**: Player position snaps to tile centers
- **Cooldown**: 120ms between moves when holding keys

### **Movement Rules**
- **Impassable Tiles**: Cannot move to DEEP_WATER or STONE
- **Living Structure Blocking**: Cannot move to tiles with alive trees/cactus (health > 0)
- **Destroyed Structure Passage**: Can move through destroyed structures (health ‚â§ 0)
- **Mud Restriction**: Only 1/3 chance to move when standing on MUD
- **Snow Restriction**: Only 1/4 chance to move when standing on SNOW
- **Shallow Water Restriction**: Only 1/3 chance to move when standing on SHALLOW_WATER
- **Village Structure Blocking**: Cannot move to tiles with non-passable POIs or living NPCs

### **Direction Tracking**
- **Facing Direction**: Always updated when movement keys pressed (even if blocked)
- **Facing Tile Logging**: Shows tile info including structure health
- **Movement Blocking**: Logs which tile type prevented movement

### **Camera System**
- **Player-Centered**: Player always renders at screen center
- **Mouse Drag**: Click and drag to move camera view
- **Tile Alignment**: World grid aligns perfectly with player position

### **NPC Movement System**
- **Tile-Based Movement**: NPCs move between 16x16 pixel tiles like the player
- **Fast Movement Cooldown**: 0.6 seconds between normal moves (increased from 1.0s)
- **Quick Retry**: 0.15 seconds retry when blocked (reduced from 0.3s)
- **High Activity**: 80% chance to attempt movement each cycle for active animals
- **Anti-Stuck Mechanism**: Force movement after 5 seconds of inactivity
- **Reduced Spacing Restrictions**: 40% avoidance of adjacent tiles (down from 70%)
- **Staggered Timing**: Random initial delays prevent synchronized movement
- **Movement Tracking**: System monitors and prevents prolonged idle periods
- **Direction Consistency**: NPCs only change facing direction when actually moving to new tiles
- **Tile Validation**: Movement only occurs when successfully changing tile coordinates
- **Negative Coordinate Support**: Fixed coordinate calculation issues for animals in negative tile positions
- **Player Collision Prevention**: NPCs cannot move to tiles occupied by the player
- **Deadlock Resolution System**: Two-phase movement with speculative coordination to prevent clustering deadlocks
  - **Movement Intention Collection**: All NPCs declare intended movements before any actual movement
  - **Coordinated Swapping**: Animals can swap positions when both want each other's tiles
  - **Chain Movement**: If one animal wants to move away, others can coordinate to take their place
  - **Deterministic Behavior**: Movement decisions cached for 100ms to ensure consistent intention-execution matching
  - **Escape Mechanism**: Long-stuck animals (8+ seconds) get increased randomness to break deadlocks

## üéí **Inventory System**

### **Inventory Structure**
- **Slots**: 9 inventory slots (accessible via keys 1-9)

- **Damage Feedback**: Real-time health updates displayed

## üèòÔ∏è **Village Generation System**

### **Village Rarity & Placement**
- **Noise-Based Grid System**: Uses dedicated village noise map with world seed for deterministic placement
- **Village Grid Areas**: 50x50 tile grid areas (800x800 pixels) - only one village per grid area
- **Village Center Selection**: Within each qualifying grid area, the tile with highest village noise value (>0.85 threshold) is selected as village center
- **Biome Restriction**: Villages only spawn on GRASS tiles
- **One Entity Per Tile**: Strict enforcement prevents multiple structures on same tile
- **Deterministic Placement**: Same seed always generates villages in same locations

### **Village Layout**
| Structure | Position | Spawn Rate | Requirements |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Windmill** | Village center (best noise tile in grid area) | 1 per grid area | GRASS tile, animated (2-second cycle) |
| **Food Market** | Exactly 8 tiles east of windmill | 1 per village | Valid terrain (not water/stone) |
| **Butcher Market** | Exactly 8 tiles west of windmill | 1 per village | Valid terrain (not water/stone) |
| **Armory Market** | Exactly 8 tiles south of windmill | 1 per village | Valid terrain (not water/stone) |
| **Cloth Market** | Exactly 8 tiles north of windmill | 1 per village | Valid terrain (not water/stone) |

### **Village Animals**
- **Quantity**: Optimized spawn density (12 strategic positions around village centers)
- **Types**: Chicken, Pig, Sheep (random selection)
- **Placement**: 5-7 tiles from village center with strategic spacing to prevent clustering
- **Enhanced Anti-Clustering**: 2-tile minimum spacing radius between all animals
- **Multi-Layer Spacing Checks**:
  - VillageGenerator: Checks 2-tile radius for existing animals
  - Chunk: Validates spacing before adding NPCs
  - WorldGenerator: Enhanced occupancy tracking during generation
- **Movement Space**: Each animal requires at least 3 adjacent passable tiles
- **Terrain Restriction**: Cannot spawn on DEEP_WATER or STONE (can spawn in SHALLOW_WATER)
- **One Entity Per Tile**: Only one structure/NPC per tile (strict enforcement)

### **Village Generation Process**
1. **Grid Area Evaluation**: Each 50x50 tile area is evaluated for village potential
2. **Best Tile Selection**: Within qualifying areas, the tile with highest village noise value becomes village center
3. **Windmill Placement**: Single windmill placed at selected center tile
4. **Market Distribution**: Markets placed exactly 8 tiles away in cardinal directions during tile-by-tile generation
5. **Animal Placement**: Village animals placed at predetermined offsets (¬±4, ¬±6 tiles) from village center during tile-by-tile generation
6. **Conflict Prevention**: Each tile is processed individually, ensuring no two entities occupy the same tile
7. **Area Marking**: Grid area marked as occupied to prevent duplicate villages

### **Biome Restrictions for Structures**
- **POI Structures** (windmills, markets): Cannot be placed on DEEP_WATER, SHALLOW_WATER, or STONE tiles
- **NPC Animals**: Cannot be placed on DEEP_WATER or STONE tiles, but CAN be placed in SHALLOW_WATER

### **Tile-Based Movement Rules**
- **One Entity Per Tile**: Only one structure, POI, or NPC can occupy a single tile at any time
- **Collision Detection**: NPCs check tile availability before moving to new positions
- **Spacing Preferences**: Animals and friendly NPCs prefer tiles that maintain 1-tile spacing from other NPCs
- **Fallback Movement**: If no spaced tiles available, NPCs fall back to basic collision avoidance
- **Movement Blocking**: NPCs cannot move to tiles occupied by:
  - Living trees or cactus (health > 0)

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Tile-Based Movement System**
- **Movement Cooldown**: 1.5-second delay between moves (slower than player's 120ms)
- **Movement Logic**: NPCs choose one adjacent tile based on current state:
  - **Following**: Move towards player (when has wheat)
  - **Fleeing**: Move away from player/monsters (when damaged)
  - **Attacking**: Move towards player (monsters only)
  - **Wandering**: Random adjacent tile (default state)
- **Collision Detection**: NPCs check for occupied tiles and avoid other NPCs
- **Boundary Enforcement**: 5-tile wandering radius, 10-tile maximum from spawn
- **Tile Selection**: Prioritizes movement based on direction with largest distance component
- **Performance**: NPCs updated within 35-tile radius of player (matches camera view)

### **Chunk-Based Entity Management**
- **NPC Tracking**: Each chunk maintains a map of NPCs by tile coordinates
- **Cross-Chunk Movement**: NPCs can move between chunks with proper state transfer
- **Collision Detection**: Real-time tile occupancy checking prevents entity overlap
- **Entity Registration**: NPCs automatically registered in chunk system during village generation
- **Memory Efficiency**: Only loaded chunks track entity positions

### **Seed-Based Generation**
- **Deterministic World**: Same seed always generates identical worlds
- **Multiple Noise Maps**: Separate noise functions for villages, animals, mines
- **Noise Scaling**: Different frequency scales for different feature types

- **Anti-Clustering**: Spacing enforcement prevents structure overlap

### **Game State**
```typescript
{
  player: {
    position: { x: number, y: number },
    inventory: InventoryItem[],
    health: number,
    attackDamage: number
  },

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Visibility Culling**: Only render visible tiles and structures
- **Tile Caching**: Cache visible tiles to avoid recalculation
- **Change Detection**: Only update when camera/player moves
- **Animation System**: Efficient structure rendering and updates
- **Chunk-Based Loading**: 16x16 tile chunks for efficient world streaming
- **Camera-Based NPC Updates**: NPCs only updated within camera view + 5-tile buffer (adaptive to screen resolution)
- **Dynamic View Radius**: Update radius calculated from camera dimensions (canvas width/height in tiles)

### **Game Loop**
- **Target FPS**: 60 FPS
- **Fixed Timestep**: Consistent 16.67ms updates
- **Delta Time**: Proper time-based calculations for animations
- **Update Throttling**: Expensive operations only when needed
- **Animation Updates**: Smooth frame transitions using game loop timing

### Anti-Clustering System
- **Multi-Layer Validation**: Three-tier spacing enforcement (VillageGenerator, WorldGenerator, Chunk.ts)
- **2-Tile Minimum Radius**: Animals require at least 2 empty tiles around them
- **Adequate Movement Space**: Minimum 3 passable adjacent tiles for animal mobility
- **Spawn Rejection Logging**: Console feedback for blocked spawn attempts
- **Real-Time Validation**: Dynamic spacing checks during NPC addition to chunks

### Species Grouping System
- **Same-Type Attraction**: Animals are more likely to spawn near others of their species
- **Detection Radius**: 4-tile radius check for nearby animals of the same type
- **Grouping Bonus**: 3x higher spawn probability for same species when nearby animals detected
- **Natural Herds**: Creates realistic animal clustering (pig herds, chicken flocks, sheep groups)
- **Balanced Randomness**: Still allows diverse spawning while encouraging species grouping
- **Applied to All Animals**: Both village and wild animals use species-preference logic

### Dynamic Cluster Behavior
- **Personal Space Mechanism**: Animals escape when surrounded by 3+ same-type animals within 2 tiles
- **Crowded Repulsion**: 40% chance to move away from cluster center when feeling crowded
- **Clustered Movement Boost**: Animals near others have 90% movement chance (vs 80% isolated)
- **Enhanced Avoidance**: 30% chance to move away from nearby animals when clustered (vs 20% isolated)
- **Boosted Exploration**: 35% chance for exploration when clustered (vs 25% isolated)
- **Restlessness System**: Movement probability increases by up to 30% after 3+ seconds of inactivity
- **Reduced Attraction Penalties**: Less severe attraction reduction when near same-type animals
- **Distance-Based Attraction**: Attraction strength decreases when already near other same-type animals
- **Isolation Response**: Isolated animals have 50% higher attraction to find their species
- **Dynamic Attraction Rates**: 10-40% attraction chance based on local population density
- **Edge Liberation**: Animals on cluster edges can now move outward for exploration
- **Adjacent Movement Allowed**: Animals can move next to each other, only avoiding overcrowded situations
