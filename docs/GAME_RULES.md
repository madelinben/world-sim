# World Simulator - Game Rules & Mechanics (Updated December 2024)

## üåç **World Generation**

### **Tile System**
- **Tile Size**: 16x16 pixels
- **Chunk System**: 16x16 tiles per chunk for efficient loading
- **Procedural Generation**: Uses simplex noise with configurable seeds
- **Grid Alignment**: Perfect tile grid with 1px black borders

### **Three-Layer Tile Rendering**
Each tile consists of three distinct visual layers rendered in order:

1. **Base Color Layer** (Bottom)
   - Solid color square representing the tile type (GRASS, WATER, etc.)
   - 14x14 pixels with 1px black border gap
   - Used for quick terrain identification

2. **Background Sprite Layer** (Middle)
   - Textured sprite overlay for visual detail (e.g., grass variants, water textures)
   - 16x16 pixel sprites from sprite sheets (TexturedGrass.png, Shore.png)
   - Optional - not all tile types have background sprites
   - GRASS tiles have 6 variants mapped deterministically by coordinates
   - FOREST tiles also use textured grass variants for enhanced visual appeal

3. **Occupied Entity Layer** (Top)
   - Interactive game objects (NPCs, POIs, structures)
   - Animated sprites (animals, windmills, trees)
   - Only one entity per tile allowed
   - Rendered on top with proper collision detection

### **Tile Data Structure**
```typescript
interface Tile {
  // Base tile properties
  x: number;
  y: number;
  value: TileType;           // GRASS, WATER, etc. (determines base color)
  prevValue?: TileType;      // For player movement tracking
  interacted?: boolean;      // For player interaction state
  height: number;            // Elevation for world generation
  temperature: number;       // Climate data
  humidity: number;          // Climate data
  riverValue?: number;       // Water flow data
  flowDirection?: number;    // Water flow direction
  spriteId?: string;         // Background sprite path (e.g., TexturedGrass.png#1,0)
  dirtTimer?: number;        // For DIRT -> GRASS regeneration

  // Occupied entities (only one type per tile)
  trees?: Tree[];            // Animated tree structures
  cactus?: Cactus[];         // Animated cactus structures
  villageStructures?: VillageStructure[]; // Village POIs and NPCs
}
```

### **Tile Types**
| Tile Type | Description | Player Movement | NPC Movement | Color |

### **DIRT Tile Regeneration**
- **Creation**: DIRT tiles are created when trees are destroyed
- **Regeneration Time**: 30 seconds to convert back to GRASS
- **Appearance**: Light brown color (#CD853F) distinguishes from MUD
- **Purpose**: Temporary tile type showing environmental recovery

### **Biome Generation**
The world generates based on three noise layers:

1. **Height Map** (elevation)
2. **Temperature Map** (climate zones)
3. **Humidity Map** (moisture levels)

### **Biome Distribution**
Generated based on temperature and humidity:

**Cold Regions (temp < 0.2)**:
- High elevation: SNOW ‚Üí STONE ‚Üí COBBLESTONE (enhanced snow coverage at height > 0.75)
- High humidity: FOREST
- Low humidity: GRASS ‚Üí STONE

**Temperate Regions (0.4 < temp < 0.7)**:
- High elevation: SNOW ‚Üí STONE ‚Üí COBBLESTONE (enhanced snow coverage at height > 0.65)
- High humidity: FOREST ‚Üí GRASS
- Near water: CLAY/MUD mix
- Low humidity: SAND

**Hot Regions (temp > 0.7)**:
- High elevation: STONE ‚Üí COBBLESTONE
- High humidity: GRASS
- Low humidity: SAND (70% chance)

### **Background Sprite System**
- **Grass Variants**: 6 different TexturedGrass.png variants (0-5) mapped to 3√ó2 grid
- **Forest Background**: FOREST tiles use the same textured grass variants for enhanced visual depth
- **Water Tiles**: Shore.png sprites for shallow/deep water (variants 2 and 4)
- **Sand Tiles**: Shore.png sprite for sand (variant 0)
- **Automatic Assignment**: Tiles automatically get sprite IDs based on coordinates
- **Deterministic Mapping**: Same coordinates always get same grass variant
- **Performance**: Background sprites render behind all entities

## üö∂ **Movement System**

### **Basic Movement**
- **Controls**: WASD or Arrow Keys
- **Grid-Based**: Player moves one tile at a time
- **Tile Snapping**: Player position snaps to tile centers
- **Cooldown**: 120ms between moves when holding keys

### **Movement Rules**
- **Impassable Tiles**: Cannot move to DEEP_WATER, SHALLOW_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, or SNOW
- **Living Structure Blocking**: Cannot move to tiles with alive trees (health > 0)
- **Cactus Collision System**: Living cactus (health > 0) are impassable and cause bounce-back
  - **Damage**: 5 HP damage when attempting to move onto cactus
  - **Bounce-back**: Entity remains at previous position, movement blocked
  - **Cooldown**: 1-second damage immunity prevents repeated damage
  - **All Entities**: Affects player, NPCs, animals, traders, and monsters
- **Destroyed Structure Passage**: Can move through destroyed structures (health ‚â§ 0)
- **Mud Restriction**: Only 1/3 chance to move when standing on MUD
- **Village Structure Blocking**: Cannot move to tiles with non-passable POIs (wells, markets, windmills, entrances) or living NPCs
- **UI Movement Restrictions**: Arrow keys disabled for player movement when inventory UI is open
  - **Other UI Types**: Text box and tombstone UI also pause movement through game logic pause
  - **Directional Updates**: Player facing direction still updates when UI is open
  - **Action Blocking**: Attack and interact actions disabled during UI display

### **Direction Tracking**
- **Facing Direction**: Always updated when movement keys pressed (even if blocked)
- **Facing Tile Logging**: Shows tile info including structure health
- **Movement Blocking**: Logs which tile type prevented movement

### **Camera System**
- **Player-Centered**: Player always renders at screen center
- **Mouse Drag**: Click and drag to move camera view
- **Tile Alignment**: World grid aligns perfectly with player position

### **NPC Movement System**
- **Tile-Based Movement**: NPCs move between 16x16 pixel tiles like the player
- **Slowed Movement Cooldown**: 1.2 seconds between normal moves (reduced from 0.6s for more realistic pacing)
- **Quick Retry**: 0.3 seconds retry when blocked (reduced from 0.6s)
- **High Activity**: 80% chance to attempt movement each cycle for active animals
- **Anti-Stuck Mechanism**: Force movement after 5 seconds of inactivity
- **Reduced Spacing Restrictions**: 40% avoidance of adjacent tiles (down from 70%)
- **Staggered Timing**: Random initial delays prevent synchronized movement
- **Movement Tracking**: System monitors and prevents prolonged idle periods
- **Direction Consistency**: NPCs only change facing direction when actually moving to new tiles
- **Tile Validation**: Movement only occurs when successfully changing tile coordinates
- **Negative Coordinate Support**: Fixed coordinate calculation issues for animals in negative tile positions
- **Player Collision Prevention**: NPCs cannot move to tiles occupied by the player
- **Deadlock Resolution System**: Two-phase movement with speculative coordination to prevent clustering deadlocks
  - **Movement Intention Collection**: All NPCs declare intended movements before any actual movement
  - **Coordinated Swapping**: Animals can swap positions when both want each other's tiles
  - **Chain Movement**: If one animal wants to move away, others can coordinate to take their place
  - **Deterministic Behavior**: Movement decisions cached for 100ms to ensure consistent intention-execution matching
  - **Escape Mechanism**: Long-stuck animals (8+ seconds) get increased randomness to break deadlocks

## üíÄ **Death & Tombstone System**

### **Entity Death Mechanics**
- **Player Death**: When player health ‚â§ 0
  - Creates tombstone at death location with player's complete 9-slot inventory
  - Player respawns at world origin (0,0) with full health and empty inventory
  - Player must retrieve items from tombstone by interacting with it
- **Animal Death** (chicken, pig, sheep): When killed by player
  - Inventory items automatically transferred to player inventory
  - No tombstone created (animals consumed immediately)
- **Trader/Monster Death**: When health ‚â§ 0
  - Creates tombstone with NPC's 9-slot inventory
  - Tombstone becomes interactable POI on the tile
  - Original NPC removed from world

### **Tombstone Interaction System**
- **Activation**: Press `F` key while facing a tombstone to open inventory UI
- **Navigation**: Use `Left/Right` arrow keys to navigate through 9 inventory slots
- **Item Selection**: Selected slot highlighted with blue border
- **Take Selected Item**: Press `X` key to take only the selected item
- **Take All Items**: Press `Z` key to transfer all tombstone items to player inventory
- **Close Interface**: Press `F` key again to close tombstone inventory UI
- **Inventory Management**: Items stack with existing player inventory when possible
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Tombstones automatically disappear when inventory becomes empty

### **Tombstone UI Features**
- **3x3 Grid Layout**: Tombstone inventory displayed in organized grid format

- **Visual Feedback**: Selected slot highlighted, item quantities displayed
- **Bubble Design**: Modern rounded UI matching game's aesthetic
- **Instruction Text**: Built-in help text showing available controls

### **Tombstone System**

- **Inventory Storage**: Each tombstone holds 9 inventory slots from dead entity
- **Position Tracking**: Tombstones placed at exact death location
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Tombstones disappear when inventory becomes empty
- **Naming**: Tombstones display entity type (e.g., "Player's Grave", "Orc Grave")

### **NPC Inventory System**
All NPCs now have 9-slot inventories with randomly generated items:

**Animal Inventories**:
- **Chicken**: 1-3 chicken_meat, 1-2 feather
- **Pig**: 2-5 pork, 1-2 leather
- **Sheep**: 1-3 mutton, 2-5 wool

**Trader Inventories**:

**Slime Inventories**:
- **All Slimes**: 2-6 slime, 1-3 blue_essence

## üèöÔ∏è **Dungeon System**

### **Enhanced Dungeon Generation**
- **Connected Tunnel System**: Uses entrance position to generate a single winding tunnel path
- **Extended Main Tunnel**: Primary corridor extends up to 50 tiles from entrance using noise-based pathfinding
- **Enhanced NPC Movement Space**: Significantly expanded passable areas for NPC movement throughout dungeons
- **Moderate Branching**: Secondary tunnels (15-30 tiles) with 25% spawn chance for exploration variety

- **Mixed Flooring**: Random mix of STONE (60%) and COBBLESTONE (40%) for visual variety

### **Advanced Dungeon NPC Movement System**

#### **Two-Phase Movement Coordination (Like World System)**
The dungeon implements the same sophisticated flocking algorithm as the world system:
- **Phase 1**: Collect movement intentions from ALL NPCs within 50-tile radius for coordination
- **Phase 2**: Execute updates with registered movement intentions for deadlock resolution

#### **Enhanced Search and Update Radius**
- **NPC Collection Radius**: 50-tile radius to find ALL dungeon NPCs (expanded from 15 tiles)
- **Update Radius**: 30-tile radius for actual NPC updates (expanded from 15 tiles)
- **Flocking Coordination**: All NPCs share movement intentions for swapping and coordination
- **Speculative Movement**: NPCs can coordinate to swap positions when blocked

#### **Movement Intention System**
- **Intention Collection**: NPCs declare movement targets before any actual movement
- **Coordinated Swapping**: NPCs can swap positions when both want each other's tiles
- **Chain Movement**: If one NPC wants to move away, others can coordinate to take their place
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Movement decisions cached for 100ms to ensure consistent intention-execution matching
- **Escape Mechanism**: Long-stuck NPCs (8+ seconds) get increased randomness to break deadlocks

#### **Dungeon-Specific Collision System**
- **VOID Tile Blocking**: Only VOID tiles and impassable structures block movement in dungeons
- **World Content Isolation**: World trees, cactus, and world NPCs don't affect dungeon movement
- **Dynamic Tile Creation**: System creates passable STONE tiles for NPCs when moving to VOID areas
- **Automatic Cache Updates**: Dungeon tile cache automatically updates when NPCs create new passable areas

### **Player Movement & Tile Validation**
- **Rendering Mode-Based Movement**: Movement system automatically switches between world and dungeon tile checking
- **Dungeon Movement Rules**: In dungeon mode, only VOID tiles and impassable structures block movement
- **World Movement Rules**: In world mode, standard world passability rules apply (water, stone, trees, etc.)
- **Isolated Systems**: World content (trees, cactus, world NPCs) completely isolated from dungeon movement
- **Smart Tile Detection**: System automatically uses appropriate tile source based on camera rendering mode

### **Dungeon Entrances & Exits**
- **Surface Entrance**: POI remains at exact world coordinates in both world and dungeon views
- **Entrance Interaction**: F key switches camera to dungeon rendering mode
- **Smart Player Spawning**: Player spawns at nearest unoccupied tile to entrance (searches up to 10 tiles)
- **Single Portal Generation**: Exactly one portal spawns 45-50 tiles from entrance (30% chance per valid tile)
- **Guaranteed Exit**: Portal generation ensures players can always return to surface
- **Portal Exit**: F key interaction returns to surface at nearest unoccupied tile to entrance
- **Cache Management**: Dungeon chunks automatically cleared when entering new dungeons for fresh generation

### **Rendering System Isolation**

- **Final Stage**: Trees stop growing at FULL stage
- **Real-Time**: Growth continues based on game time

### **Tree Destruction**
- **Broken Stumps**: Destroyed trees become CUT_DOWN stage (sprite index 0)
- **Passable**: Broken stumps allow player movement through them
- **Visual Persistence**: Stumps remain visible on tile
- **No Removal**: Trees remain as stumps, don't disappear

## üåµ **Cactus Growth System**

- **No Stumps**: Unlike trees, no visual remains after destruction
- **Tile Conversion**: Tile converts to SAND (permanent)
- **Animation System**: Cactus removed from rendering system

### **Cactus Damage System**
- **Environmental Hazard**: Living cactus deal damage to entities standing on their tiles
- **Damage Amount**: 5 damage per frame to any entity (player, NPCs) on living cactus tiles
- **Area of Effect**: 20-tile radius checking around player for efficient damage application
- **Entity Filtering**: Only affects entities with health > 0 (living entities)
- **Console Logging**: Damage events logged for debugging and feedback

## ‚öîÔ∏è **Combat System**

### **Player Combat Stats**
- **Attack Damage**: 5 damage per attack (reduced from 10)

- **Health Tracking**: Target health decreases with each attack
- **Destruction Threshold**: Targets destroyed when health ‚â§ 0
- **Priority System**: Trees ‚Üí Cactus ‚Üí NPCs ‚Üí Nothing
- **Blocking System**: Hold G key to reduce incoming damage to 1 (from any amount)

### **Enhanced NPC Combat System**

#### **Trader Defensive Combat**
Trader NPCs implement sophisticated defensive behavior when encountering monsters:
- **Monster Detection**: Traders detect monsters within 5-tile radius
- **Defensive Attacks**: When not being attacked, traders can attack adjacent monsters dealing 5 damage
- **Auto-Blocking Mechanism**: When being attacked by monsters, traders automatically block, reducing damage from 5 to 1
- **Attack State Detection**: Traders check if monsters are currently attacking them before deciding to counter-attack
- **Priority System**: Defensive combat takes priority over village structure attraction
- **Loot Collection**: Traders collect drops from monsters they kill
- **Flee Behavior**: Traders still flee from monsters when not in defensive position
- **Console Feedback**: System logs when traders block attacks: "üõ°Ô∏è [TraderType] blocks attack from [MonsterType]!"

#### **Monster Combat Behavior**
Monsters implement aggressive combat with multiple target types:
- **Primary Targets**: Animals, traders, and players (player has priority 2, NPCs priority 1)
- **Attack Damage**: 5 damage to friendly NPCs and players
- **Monster vs Monster**: 10% chance to attack other monsters, dealing 3 damage
- **No Blocking**: Monsters never block attacks, always take full damage
- **Loot Collection**: Monsters collect drops from any NPCs they kill (including other monsters)
- **Attack Cooldown**: 1 second between attacks

### **Combat Damage Matrix**
| Attacker | Target | Base Damage | Blocked Damage | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Player** | Any NPC/Structure | 5 | N/A | Standard attack damage |
| **Monster** | Player | 5 | 1 (if blocking) | Player can block with G key |
| **Monster** | Friendly NPC | 5 | 1 (auto-block) | Traders auto-block when being attacked |
| **Monster** | Other Monster | 3 | 3 (no blocking) | Monsters never block |
| **Trader** | Monster | 5 | N/A | Defensive combat only |

### **Monster Drop Collection System**
- **Automatic Collection**: When monster NPCs kill other NPCs, victim drops are automatically added to monster inventory
- **Inventory Integration**: Monster NPCs have 9-slot inventories that intelligently stack items
- **Smart Stacking**: Items of same type automatically combine up to stack limits
- **Console Logging**: Real-time feedback shows successful collections: "üéØ [MonsterType] collected [quantity]x [item]"
- **Inventory Full Handling**: Monsters with full inventories display warning: "‚ö†Ô∏è [MonsterType] inventory full, couldn't collect [item]"
- **No Tombstone Creation**: When monsters kill NPCs, items go directly to monster inventory (no tombstone spawned)
- **Monster Death Drops**: When monsters die, their collected items drop normally creating tombstones

### **NPC Combat & Drops**
| NPC Type | Health | Drops When Defeated | Behavior When Attacked |
|----------|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Chicken** | 20 HP | 1x Chicken Meat | Flees, becomes 'fleeing' state |

- **Village Grid Areas**: 50x50 tile grid areas (800x800 pixels) - only one village per grid area
- **Village Center Selection**: Within each qualifying grid area, the tile with highest village noise value (>0.85 threshold) is selected as village center
- **Biome Restriction**: Villages only spawn on GRASS tiles
- **One Entity Per Tile**: Strict enforcement prevents multiple structures on same tile
- **Deterministic Placement**: Same seed always generates villages in same locations

### **Well-Centered Village Layout**
| Structure | Position | Spawn Rate | Requirements |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Water Well** | Village center (best noise tile in grid area) | 1 per grid area | GRASS tile, interactable (restores 25 health) |
| **Windmill** | Randomly placed 6-10 tiles from well | 1 per village | Valid terrain (not water/stone), animated (2-second cycle) |
| **Food Market** | Randomly placed 6-10 tiles from well | 1 per village | Valid terrain (not water/stone) |

2. **NPCs (Lowest Priority)**: Animals placed last to avoid conflicts with structures
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Village structure POIs take precedence when placing in tiles
4. **Random Placement**: Structures are placed in a spiral pattern around the well using deterministic randomization
5. **Distance Constraints**: POI structures (6-10 tiles from well), NPCs (12-15 tiles from well)

### **Village Animals**
- **Quantity**: Optimized spawn density around village perimeter
- **Types**: Chicken, Pig, Sheep (random selection with species grouping)
- **Placement**: 12-15 tiles from well center to avoid conflicts with POI structures

- **Terrain Restriction**: Cannot spawn on DEEP_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, SNOW, or SHALLOW_WATER
- **Spawn Probability**: 30% chance per suitable tile for balanced population density

### **Village Generation Process**
1. **Grid Area Evaluation**: Each 50x50 tile area is evaluated for village potential
2. **Best Tile Selection**: Within qualifying areas, the tile with highest village noise value becomes village center
3. **Well Placement**: Single water well placed at selected center tile
4. **POI Structure Distribution**: Windmill and markets placed randomly in 6-10 tile radius from well
5. **Animal Placement**: Village animals placed randomly in 12-15 tile radius from well during tile-by-tile generation
6. **Conflict Prevention**: Each tile is processed individually, ensuring POI structures take precedence over NPCs
7. **Area Marking**: Grid area marked as occupied to prevent duplicate villages

### **Biome Restrictions for Structures**
- **POI Structures** (wells, windmills, markets): Cannot be placed on DEEP_WATER, SHALLOW_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, or SNOW tiles
- **NPC Animals**: Cannot be placed on DEEP_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, SNOW, or SHALLOW_WATER tiles

### **Village Structure Spacing Requirements**
- **POI Structure Spacing**: Minimum 2-tile spacing radius between all POI structures (wells, windmills, markets)
- **Spacing Validation**: System prevents placement of POI structures too close to existing POI structures
- **Animal Spacing**: Minimum 2-tile spacing radius between all NPCs for adequate movement space

- **Reduced Logging**: Only logs successful movements and important errors to avoid console spam

#### **Trader-Specific Flocking Behavior**
Trader NPCs implement specialized flocking AI distinct from animal behavior:
- **Village Structure Attraction**: Actively move towards nearby village buildings within 5-tile detection range
  - **Primary Targets**: Water wells, markets, windmills, notice boards
  - **Attraction Strength**: Similar to animal wheat-following but for structures
- **Monster Avoidance**: Flee from hostile monsters (orcs, goblins, skeletons, slimes) within detection range
  - **Avoidance Priority**: Monster avoidance overrides structure attraction
  - **Flee Distance**: Move away from monsters until outside detection range
- **Player Neutrality**: Traders do NOT follow or avoid players unless attacked
  - **No Wheat Response**: Unlike animals, traders ignore players carrying wheat
  - **Combat Response**: Only flee from player if attacked (enters 'fleeing' state)

- **Spacing Preferences**: Animals and friendly NPCs prefer tiles that maintain 1-tile spacing from other NPCs
- **Fallback Movement**: If no spaced tiles available, NPCs fall back to basic collision avoidance
- **Movement Blocking**: NPCs cannot move to tiles occupied by:
  - Living trees or cactus (health > 0)
  - Impassable POIs (markets, windmills, chests)
  - Other living NPCs
  - Impassable terrain (DEEP_WATER, SHALLOW_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, SNOW)
- **Direction Updates**: NPC facing direction is updated before moving to new tile
- **Movement Validation**: If target tile is occupied, NPC velocity is reduced to prevent jittering
- **Chunk-Based Tracking**: NPC positions are tracked per chunk for efficient collision detection

- **Species Compatibility**: Only identical animal types can breed (chicken + chicken, pig + pig, sheep + sheep)
- **Breeding Cooldown**: 30-second cooldown between breeding attempts per animal
- **Facing Requirement**: Both animals must be facing directly towards each other
- **Offspring Placement**: New animals spawn in adjacent tiles near the parents
- **Real-Time Breeding**: Breeding attempts occur during normal game updates
- **Breeding Success**: Successful breeding creates a new NPC of the same type with full health
- **Breeding Failure**: If no suitable adjacent tile is available, breeding fails but animals can try again after cooldown
- **Population Growth**: Allows for dynamic animal population expansion in villages and wild areas
- **Visual Feedback**: Console logs successful breeding events with parent locations
- **World System Integration**: Breeding requests are handled by the World system for proper entity management

### **Animation System for NPCs**

- **Natural Herds**: Creates realistic animal clustering (pig herds, chicken flocks, sheep groups)
- **Balanced Randomness**: Still allows diverse spawning while encouraging species grouping
- **Applied to All Animals**: Both village and wild animals use species-preference logic

### **Dynamic Cluster Behavior**
- **Personal Space Mechanism**: Animals escape when surrounded by 3+ same-type animals within 2 tiles
- **Crowded Repulsion**: 40% chance to move away from cluster center when feeling crowded
- **Clustered Movement Boost**: Animals near others have 90% movement chance (vs 80% isolated)
- **Enhanced Avoidance**: 30% chance to move away from nearby animals when clustered (vs 20% isolated)
- **Boosted Exploration**: 35% chance for exploration when clustered (vs 25% isolated)
- **Restlessness System**: Movement probability increases by up to 30% after 3+ seconds of inactivity
- **Reduced Attraction Penalties**: Less severe attraction reduction when near same-type animals
- **Distance-Based Attraction**: Attraction strength decreases when already near other same-type animals
- **Isolation Response**: Isolated animals have 50% higher attraction to find their species
- **Dynamic Attraction Rates**: 10-40% attraction chance based on local population density
- **Edge Liberation**: Animals on cluster edges can now move outward for exploration
- **Adjacent Movement Allowed**: Animals can move next to each other, only avoiding overcrowded situations

### **Advanced Movement Coordination System**

#### **Two-Phase Movement Algorithm**
Both world and dungeon systems implement sophisticated movement coordination to prevent NPC clustering and deadlocks:

**Phase 1: Intention Collection**
- All NPCs within update radius declare their intended movement targets
- Movement intentions registered globally before any actual movement occurs
- System builds map of target tiles and which NPCs want to move there

**Phase 2: Coordinated Execution**
- NPCs execute movements with full knowledge of other NPCs' intentions
- Speculative movement allows position swapping and chain movements
- Deadlock resolution through coordinated group movement

#### **Movement Intention System**
- **getMovementIntention()**: NPCs calculate target positions without actually moving
- **Intention Caching**: Movement decisions cached for 100ms to ensure consistency
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Same NPC always makes same decision given same conditions
- **Global Coordination**: All NPCs in area share movement intentions for coordination

#### **Speculative Movement & Deadlock Resolution**
- **Position Swapping**: Two NPCs wanting each other's tiles can swap positions
- **Chain Movement**: If NPC A wants to move away, NPC B can take A's position
- **Bidirectional Coordination**: System detects mutual movement desires
- **Escape Mechanisms**: Long-stuck NPCs (8+ seconds) get enhanced randomness to break deadlocks

#### **Collision Callbacks & Coordination**
- **setTileCollisionCallback()**: Each NPC gets tile-specific collision detection
- **setSpeculativeMovementCallback()**: Enables coordination with other NPCs
- **Context-Aware Collision**: Different collision rules for world vs dungeon modes
- **Dynamic Tile Creation**: Dungeon NPCs can create passable tiles when needed

#### **Performance Optimization**
- **Radius-Based Updates**: Only NPCs within view radius + buffer are updated
- **Intention Sharing**: All NPCs share intentions but only nearby ones execute
- **Cache Efficiency**: Movement decisions cached to avoid recalculation
- **Staggered Processing**: NPCs have random initial delays to prevent synchronization

### **Enhanced Collision Detection System**
- **Mode-Aware Collision**: Different collision rules for world vs dungeon rendering modes
- **Dynamic Context Switching**: Movement system automatically adapts to current camera rendering mode
- **Callback-Based Architecture**: NPCs use collision callbacks for tile-specific movement validation
- **Speculative Movement**: Advanced coordination system allows NPCs to negotiate position swaps
- **Isolated Systems**: World and dungeon collision systems completely separate to prevent interference

### **Advanced Movement Intention Architecture**
- **Two-Phase Processing**: Intention collection phase followed by coordinated execution phase
- **Global Intention Map**: Shared data structure tracking all NPC movement desires
- **Deterministic Caching**: Movement decisions cached for 100ms to ensure execution matches intention
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Multiple escape mechanisms for stuck NPCs including increased randomness
- **Cross-System Implementation**: Same algorithm used in both world and dungeon systems

### **Dungeon System Enhancements**
- **Dynamic Tile Generation**: NPCs can create passable STONE tiles when moving into VOID areas
- **Cache Synchronization**: Dungeon chunk cache automatically updates when NPCs modify tile data
- **Enhanced Tunnel Generation**: Expanded passable areas with rooms, corridors, and connecting paths
- **Isolated Rendering**: Complete separation of world and dungeon content during rendering
- **Fresh Generation**: Dungeon caches cleared when entering new dungeons for consistent experience
