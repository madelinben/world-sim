# World Simulator - Game Rules & Mechanics (Updated December 2024)

## üåç **World Generation**

### **Tile System**
- **Tile Size**: 16x16 pixels
- **Chunk System**: 16x16 tiles per chunk for efficient loading
- **Procedural Generation**: Uses simplex noise with configurable seeds
- **Grid Alignment**: Perfect tile grid with 1px black borders

### **Three-Layer Tile Rendering**
Each tile consists of three distinct visual layers rendered in order:

1. **Base Color Layer** (Bottom)
   - Solid color square representing the tile type (GRASS, WATER, etc.)
   - 14x14 pixels with 1px black border gap
   - Used for quick terrain identification

2. **Background Sprite Layer** (Middle)
   - Textured sprite overlay for visual detail (e.g., grass variants, water textures)
   - 16x16 pixel sprites from sprite sheets (TexturedGrass.png, Shore.png)
   - Optional - not all tile types have background sprites
   - GRASS tiles have 6 variants mapped deterministically by coordinates
   - FOREST tiles also use textured grass variants for enhanced visual appeal

3. **Occupied Entity Layer** (Top)
   - Interactive game objects (NPCs, POIs, structures)
   - Animated sprites (animals, windmills, trees)
   - Only one entity per tile allowed
   - Rendered on top with proper collision detection

### **Tile Data Structure**
```typescript
interface Tile {
  // Base tile properties
  x: number;
  y: number;
  value: TileType;           // GRASS, WATER, etc. (determines base color)
  prevValue?: TileType;      // For player movement tracking
  interacted?: boolean;      // For player interaction state
  height: number;            // Elevation for world generation
  temperature: number;       // Climate data
  humidity: number;          // Climate data
  riverValue?: number;       // Water flow data
  flowDirection?: number;    // Water flow direction
  spriteId?: string;         // Background sprite path (e.g., TexturedGrass.png#1,0)
  dirtTimer?: number;        // For DIRT -> GRASS regeneration

  // Occupied entities (only one type per tile)
  trees?: Tree[];            // Animated tree structures
  cactus?: Cactus[];         // Animated cactus structures
  villageStructures?: VillageStructure[]; // Village POIs and NPCs
}
```

### **DIRT Tile Regeneration**
- **Creation**: DIRT tiles are created when trees are destroyed
- **Regeneration Time**: 30 seconds to convert back to GRASS
- **Appearance**: Light brown color (#CD853F) distinguishes from MUD
- **Purpose**: Temporary tile type showing environmental recovery

### **Biome Generation**
The world generates based on three noise layers:

1. **Height Map** (elevation)
2. **Temperature Map** (climate zones)
3. **Humidity Map** (moisture levels)

### **Biome Distribution**
Generated based on temperature and humidity:

**Cold Regions (temp < 0.2)**:
- High elevation: SNOW ‚Üí STONE ‚Üí COBBLESTONE (enhanced snow coverage at height > 0.75)
- High humidity: FOREST
- Low humidity: GRASS ‚Üí STONE

**Temperate Regions (0.4 < temp < 0.7)**:
- High elevation: SNOW ‚Üí STONE ‚Üí COBBLESTONE (enhanced snow coverage at height > 0.65)
- High humidity: FOREST ‚Üí GRASS
- Near water: CLAY/MUD mix
- Low humidity: SAND

**Hot Regions (temp > 0.7)**:
- High elevation: STONE ‚Üí COBBLESTONE
- High humidity: GRASS
- Low humidity: SAND (70% chance)

### **Background Sprite System**
- **Grass Variants**: 6 different TexturedGrass.png variants (0-5) mapped to 3√ó2 grid
- **Forest Background**: FOREST tiles use the same textured grass variants for enhanced visual depth
- **Water Tiles**: Shore.png sprites for shallow/deep water (variants 2 and 4)
- **Sand Tiles**: Shore.png sprite for sand (variant 0)
- **Automatic Assignment**: Tiles automatically get sprite IDs based on coordinates
- **Deterministic Mapping**: Same coordinates always get same grass variant
- **Performance**: Background sprites render behind all entities

## üö∂ **Movement System**

### **Basic Movement**
- **Controls**: WASD or Arrow Keys
- **Grid-Based**: Player moves one tile at a time
- **Tile Snapping**: Player position snaps to tile centers
- **Cooldown**: 120ms between moves when holding keys

### **Movement Rules**
- **Impassable Tiles**: Cannot move to DEEP_WATER, SHALLOW_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, or SNOW
- **Living Structure Blocking**: Cannot move to tiles with alive trees (health > 0)
- **Cactus Collision System**: Living cactus (health > 0) are impassable and cause bounce-back
  - **Damage**: 5 HP damage when attempting to move onto cactus
  - **Bounce-back**: Entity remains at previous position, movement blocked
  - **Cooldown**: 1-second damage immunity prevents repeated damage
  - **All Entities**: Affects player, NPCs, animals, traders, and monsters
- **Destroyed Structure Passage**: Can move through destroyed structures (health ‚â§ 0)
- **Mud Restriction**: Only 1/3 chance to move when standing on MUD
- **Village Structure Blocking**: Cannot move to tiles with non-passable POIs (wells, markets, windmills, entrances) or living NPCs
- **UI Movement Restrictions**: Arrow keys disabled for player movement when inventory UI is open
  - **Other UI Types**: Text box and tombstone UI also pause movement through game logic pause
  - **Directional Updates**: Player facing direction still updates when UI is open
  - **Action Blocking**: Attack and interact actions disabled during UI display

### **Direction Tracking**
- **Facing Direction**: Always updated when movement keys pressed (even if blocked)
- **Facing Tile Logging**: Shows tile info including structure health
- **Movement Blocking**: Logs which tile type prevented movement

### **Camera System**

### **NPC Movement System**
- **Tile-Based Movement**: NPCs move between 16x16 pixel tiles like the player
- **Slowed Movement Cooldown**: 1.2 seconds between normal moves (reduced from 0.6s for more realistic pacing)
- **Quick Retry**: 0.3 seconds retry when blocked (reduced from 0.6s)
- **High Activity**: 80% chance to attempt movement each cycle for active animals
- **Anti-Stuck Mechanism**: Force movement after 5 seconds of inactivity
- **Reduced Spacing Restrictions**: 40% avoidance of adjacent tiles (down from 70%)
- **Staggered Timing**: Random initial delays prevent synchronized movement
- **Movement Tracking**: System monitors and prevents prolonged idle periods
- **Direction Consistency**: NPCs only change facing direction when actually moving to new tiles
- **Tile Validation**: Movement only occurs when successfully changing tile coordinates
- **Negative Coordinate Support**: Fixed coordinate calculation issues for animals in negative tile positions
- **Player Collision Prevention**: NPCs cannot move to tiles occupied by the player
- **Deadlock Resolution System**: Two-phase movement with speculative coordination to prevent clustering deadlocks
  - **Movement Intention Collection**: All NPCs declare intended movements before any actual movement
  - **Coordinated Swapping**: Animals can swap positions when both want each other's tiles
  - **Chain Movement**: If one animal wants to move away, others can coordinate to take their place
  - **Deterministic Behavior**: Movement decisions cached for 100ms to ensure consistent intention-execution matching
  - **Escape Mechanism**: Long-stuck animals (8+ seconds) get increased randomness to break deadlocks

## üë§ **Player System**

### **Player Name & Identity** - Enhanced December 2024

| **Cloth Market** | 6-10 tiles from well | 1 per village | Textiles & materials |

### **Village Trader Generation**
Each village automatically generates 5 friendly trader NPCs:
- **Spawn Location**: 6-10 tiles from village center (water well)
- **Trader Types**: Axeman Trader, Swordsman Trader, Spearman Trader, Farmer Trader
- **Behavior**: Flocking algorithm similar to animals with specific attractions
  - **Village Structure Attraction**: Attracted to village buildings (wells, markets, windmills)
  - **Monster Avoidance**: Flee from hostile monsters within detection range
  - **Player Neutrality**: NOT attracted to player (unlike animals with wheat)
  - **Spacing**: Maintain 2+ tile minimum distance from other NPCs
- **Health**: 50 HP each
- **Drops**: 1x Gold Ingot when defeated
- **Interaction**: `F` key triggers RPG dialogue system
- **Movement**: 1.2 second cooldown, avoid player collision

### **Village Naming & Identity System**
- **Grid-Based Assignment**: Villages assigned to 50x50 tile grid areas
- **Random Name Generation**: Villages get completely random names using `Math.random()` for prefix/suffix selection
- **Name Caching**: Generated names cached per village grid to ensure consistency across sessions
- **Name Storage**: Village names stored in POI customData for persistence
- **Cross-Reference System**: Notice boards can find nearby wells to get village names
- **Fallback Naming**: "Unknown Village" for edge cases or corrupted data

### **Village Rarity & Placement**
- **Noise-Based Grid System**: Uses dedicated village noise map with world seed for deterministic placement
- **Village Grid Areas**: 50x50 tile grid areas (800x800 pixels) - only one village per grid area
- **Village Center Selection**: Within each qualifying grid area, the tile with highest village noise value (>0.85 threshold) is selected as village center
- **Biome Restriction**: Villages only spawn on GRASS tiles
- **One Entity Per Tile**: Strict enforcement prevents multiple structures on same tile
- **Deterministic Placement**: Same seed always generates villages in same locations

### **Well-Centered Village Layout**
| Structure | Position | Spawn Rate | Requirements |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Water Well** | Village center (best noise tile in grid area) | 1 per grid area | GRASS tile, interactable (restores 25 health) |
| **Windmill** | Randomly placed 6-10 tiles from well | 1 per village | Valid terrain (not water/stone), animated (2-second cycle) |
| **Food Market** | Randomly placed 6-10 tiles from well | 1 per village | Valid terrain (not water/stone) |
| **Butcher Market** | Randomly placed 6-10 tiles from well | 1 per village | Valid terrain (not water/stone) |
| **Armory Market** | Randomly placed 6-10 tiles from well | 1 per village | Valid terrain (not water/stone) |
| **Cloth Market** | Randomly placed 6-10 tiles from well | 1 per village | Valid terrain (not water/stone) |

### **Village Structure Priority System**
1. **POI Structures (Highest Priority)**: Wells, windmills, markets placed first
2. **NPCs (Lowest Priority)**: Animals placed last to avoid conflicts with structures
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Village structure POIs take precedence when placing in tiles
4. **Random Placement**: Structures are placed in a spiral pattern around the well using deterministic randomization
5. **Distance Constraints**: POI structures (6-10 tiles from well), NPCs (12-15 tiles from well)

### **Village Animals**
- **Quantity**: Optimized spawn density around village perimeter
- **Types**: Chicken, Pig, Sheep (random selection with species grouping)
- **Placement**: 12-15 tiles from well center to avoid conflicts with POI structures
- **Enhanced Anti-Clustering**: 2-tile minimum spacing radius between all animals
- **Movement Space**: Each animal requires at least 3 adjacent passable tiles
- **Terrain Restriction**: Cannot spawn on DEEP_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, SNOW, or SHALLOW_WATER
- **Spawn Probability**: 30% chance per suitable tile for balanced population density

### **Village Generation Process**
1. **Grid Area Evaluation**: Each 50x50 tile area is evaluated for village potential
2. **Best Tile Selection**: Within qualifying areas, the tile with highest village noise value becomes village center
3. **Well Placement**: Single water well placed at selected center tile
4. **POI Structure Distribution**: Windmill and markets placed randomly in 6-10 tile radius from well
5. **Animal Placement**: Village animals placed randomly in 12-15 tile radius from well during tile-by-tile generation
6. **Conflict Prevention**: Each tile is processed individually, ensuring POI structures take precedence over NPCs
7. **Area Marking**: Grid area marked as occupied to prevent duplicate villages

### **Biome Restrictions for Structures**
- **POI Structures** (wells, windmills, markets): Cannot be placed on DEEP_WATER, SHALLOW_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, or SNOW tiles
- **NPC Animals**: Cannot be placed on DEEP_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, SNOW, or SHALLOW_WATER tiles

### **Village Structure Spacing Requirements**
- **POI Structure Spacing**: Minimum 2-tile spacing radius between all POI structures (wells, windmills, markets)
- **Spacing Validation**: System prevents placement of POI structures too close to existing POI structures
- **Animal Spacing**: Minimum 2-tile spacing radius between all NPCs for adequate movement space
- **Priority System**: POI structures take precedence over NPCs during village generation

### **NPC Movement & AI**
- **Detection Range**: 5 tiles radius
- **Wheat Attraction**: Animals follow players with wheat in inventory (5-tile radius)
- **Dynamic Same-Type Attraction**: Variable attraction rates (6-40%) based on local animal density
- **Tile-Based Movement**: NPCs move one tile at a time with 1.2-second cooldowns (slowed for realism)
- **Movement Logic**: Direction-based movement towards/away from targets
- **Flexible Spacing**: Animals can move adjacent to each other, only avoiding overcrowded tiles (2+ neighbors)
- **Collision Avoidance**: NPCs avoid tiles occupied by other NPCs
- **Terrain Restrictions**: NPCs cannot move onto DEEP_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, SNOW, or SHALLOW_WATER tiles
- **Personal Space System**: Animals actively escape when surrounded by 3+ same-type animals
- **Exploration Behavior**: 25% chance for random exploration overriding attraction
- **Crowded Repulsion**: Animals move away from cluster centers when feeling crowded
- **Fleeing**: Non-aggressive NPCs flee when attacked or when avoiding monsters
- **Health Bars**: Visible when damaged
- **Movement Restrictions**: NPCs stay within 5 tiles of spawn point, 10 tiles maximum
- **Directional Animation**: 4 directions √ó 4 animation frames per direction (1-second cycle)
- **AI States**: idle, wandering, following, fleeing, attacking, dead
- **Camera-Based Optimization**: Only NPCs within camera view + 5-tile buffer are updated for performance
- **Continuous Updates**: NPCs updated every frame for smooth movement and animation
- **Reduced Logging**: Only logs successful movements and important errors to avoid console spam

#### **Trader-Specific Flocking Behavior**
Trader NPCs implement specialized flocking AI distinct from animal behavior:
- **Village Structure Attraction**: Actively move towards nearby village buildings within 5-tile detection range
  - **Primary Targets**: Water wells, markets, windmills, notice boards
  - **Attraction Strength**: Similar to animal wheat-following but for structures
- **Monster Avoidance**: Flee from hostile monsters (orcs, goblins, skeletons, slimes) within detection range
  - **Avoidance Priority**: Monster avoidance overrides structure attraction
  - **Flee Distance**: Move away from monsters until outside detection range
- **Player Neutrality**: Traders do NOT follow or avoid players unless attacked
  - **No Wheat Response**: Unlike animals, traders ignore players carrying wheat
  - **Combat Response**: Only flee from player if attacked (enters 'fleeing' state)
- **Trader Clustering**: Traders avoid crowding around same structures
  - **Spacing**: Maintain 2+ tile minimum distance from other NPCs
  - **Structure Distribution**: Multiple traders spread across different village buildings

### **Tile-Based Movement Rules**
- **One Entity Per Tile**: Only one structure, POI, or NPC can occupy a single tile at any time
- **Collision Detection**: NPCs check tile availability before moving to new positions
- **Spacing Preferences**: Animals and friendly NPCs prefer tiles that maintain 1-tile spacing from other NPCs
- **Fallback Movement**: If no spaced tiles available, NPCs fall back to basic collision avoidance
- **Movement Blocking**: NPCs cannot move to tiles occupied by:
  - Living trees or cactus (health > 0)
  - Impassable POIs (markets, windmills, chests)
  - Other living NPCs
  - Impassable terrain (DEEP_WATER, SHALLOW_WATER, STONE, COBBLESTONE, SNOW)
- **Direction Updates**: NPC facing direction is updated before moving to new tile
- **Movement Validation**: If target tile is occupied, NPC velocity is reduced to prevent jittering
- **Chunk-Based Tracking**: NPC positions are tracked per chunk for efficient collision detection

### **Animal Breeding System**
- **Breeding Conditions**: Two animals of the same species must be adjacent and facing each other
- **Species Compatibility**: Only identical animal types can breed (chicken + chicken, pig + pig, sheep + sheep)
- **Breeding Cooldown**: 30-second cooldown between breeding attempts per animal
- **Facing Requirement**: Both animals must be facing directly towards each other
- **Offspring Placement**: New animals spawn in adjacent tiles near the parents
- **Real-Time Breeding**: Breeding attempts occur during normal game updates
- **Breeding Success**: Successful breeding creates a new NPC of the same type with full health
- **Breeding Failure**: If no suitable adjacent tile is available, breeding fails but animals can try again after cooldown
- **Population Growth**: Allows for dynamic animal population expansion in villages and wild areas
- **Visual Feedback**: Console logs successful breeding events with parent locations
- **World System Integration**: Breeding requests are handled by the World system for proper entity management

### **Animation System for NPCs**
- **Directional Sprites**: 4 directions (up, down, left, right)
- **Walking Animation**: 4 frames per direction, 1-second cycle
- **Direction Updates**: Direction changes based on movement
- **Animation Timing**: Frame updates tied to game loop deltaTime
- **State-Based**: Animation only when moving or performing actions

## üèóÔ∏è **Current Architecture & Future Optimization Opportunities**

### **Current System Architecture**
The game follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

#### **Core Systems**
- **Game Engine** (`src/game/engine/`): Main game loop, state management, and core game logic
- **World Management** (`src/game/world/`): Procedural world generation, chunk management, and dungeon systems
- **Entity System** (`src/game/entities/`): Player, NPCs, structures, POIs, and inventory management
- **UI System** (`src/game/ui/`): User interface components, inventory UIs, and visual feedback
- **Input/Action Systems** (`src/game/systems/`): Input processing, movement, animation, and game actions
- **Translation System** (`src/game/translations/`): Localized text and entity interaction messages
- **Asset Management** (`src/game/assets/`): Sprite mapping, asset loading, and resource management

#### **Current Design Patterns**
- **Observer Pattern**: Camera and UI systems observe player state changes
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different movement strategies for world vs dungeon environments
- **Factory Pattern**: Entity creation through chunk generation and world systems
- **Singleton Pattern**: Global systems like AnimationSystem and Camera
- **Component Pattern**: Entities composed of position, health, inventory, and behavior components

### **Identified Optimization Opportunities**

#### **1. Entity Component System (ECS) Architecture**
**Current State**: Entities use inheritance-based architecture with mixed responsibilities
**Optimization**: Implement ECS pattern for better performance and maintainability
```typescript
// Proposed ECS Structure
interface Component {}
interface PositionComponent extends Component { x: number; y: number; }
interface HealthComponent extends Component { health: number; maxHealth: number; }
interface InventoryComponent extends Component { items: InventoryItem[]; }
interface RenderComponent extends Component { sprite: Sprite; animation: AnimationData; }

class Entity {
  private components = new Map<ComponentType, Component>();
  addComponent<T extends Component>(component: T): void;
  getComponent<T extends Component>(type: ComponentType): T | null;
}

class System {
  abstract update(entities: Entity[], deltaTime: number): void;
}
```

#### **2. Service Locator Pattern**
**Current State**: Direct dependencies between systems create tight coupling
**Optimization**: Implement service locator for better dependency management
```typescript
class ServiceLocator {
  private static services = new Map<string, any>();

  static register<T>(name: string, service: T): void;
  static get<T>(name: string): T;
}

// Usage
ServiceLocator.register('worldGenerator', new WorldGenerator());
ServiceLocator.register('animationSystem', new AnimationSystem());
```

#### **3. Command Pattern for Actions**
**Current State**: Actions processed directly in ActionSystem
**Optimization**: Implement command pattern for undo/redo and action queuing
```typescript
interface Command {
  execute(): void;
  undo(): void;
}

class MoveCommand implements Command {
  constructor(private entity: Entity, private direction: Direction) {}
  execute(): void { /* move logic */ }
  undo(): void { /* reverse move */ }
}

class CommandManager {
  private history: Command[] = [];
  executeCommand(command: Command): void;
  undo(): void;
  redo(): void;
}
```

#### **4. Object Pool Pattern**
**Current State**: Entities created/destroyed frequently causing GC pressure
**Optimization**: Implement object pooling for frequently created entities
```typescript
class EntityPool<T> {
  private available: T[] = [];
  private inUse = new Set<T>();

  acquire(): T;
  release(entity: T): void;
  preAllocate(count: number): void;
}
```

#### **5. State Machine for Entity Behavior**
**Current State**: Entity behavior scattered across update methods
**Optimization**: Implement state machines for cleaner behavior management
```typescript
interface State {
  enter(entity: Entity): void;
  update(entity: Entity, deltaTime: number): void;
  exit(entity: Entity): void;
}

class StateMachine {
  private currentState: State;
  private states = new Map<string, State>();

  transition(stateName: string): void;
  update(entity: Entity, deltaTime: number): void;
}
```

#### **6. Event System for Decoupled Communication**
**Current State**: Direct method calls between systems create coupling
**Optimization**: Implement event system for loose coupling
```typescript
interface GameEvent {
  type: string;
  data?: any;
}

class EventBus {
  private listeners = new Map<string, Function[]>();

  subscribe(eventType: string, callback: Function): void;
  emit(event: GameEvent): void;
  unsubscribe(eventType: string, callback: Function): void;
}
```

### **Performance Optimization Recommendations**

#### **1. Spatial Indexing**
- Implement quadtree or spatial hash for efficient collision detection
- Reduce O(n¬≤) entity-to-entity checks to O(log n) or O(1)

#### **2. Chunk-Based Entity Management**
- Only update entities in active chunks (camera view + buffer)
- Implement entity hibernation for distant chunks

#### **3. Asset Streaming**
- Lazy load sprites and assets based on camera proximity
- Implement asset unloading for memory management

#### **4. Batch Rendering**
- Group similar sprites for batch rendering calls
- Reduce canvas context state changes

### **Maintainability Improvements**

#### **1. Configuration System**
- Centralize game constants and tuning parameters
- Support runtime configuration changes for balancing

#### **2. Plugin Architecture**
- Modular system for adding new features
- Hot-swappable components for development

#### **3. Testing Framework**
- Unit tests for core game logic
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Performance benchmarking suite

  - **World (Day)**: No monster spawning (1.0 light level)
  - **World (Night)**: Low to moderate spawning (0.2-1.0 light level)
  - **Mines**: Moderate spawning (0.5 base light, reduced near torches)
  - **Dungeons**: High spawning (0.0 light level, maximum danger)
- **Perlin Noise Distribution**: Separate monster noise map for natural placement patterns
- **Spacing Algorithm**: Minimum 4-tile distance between spawned monsters
- **Dynamic Spawning**: Continuous monster generation based on current light conditions

### **Visual Darkness System**
- **Tile-Based Rendering**: Individual tile darkness calculation for underground areas
- **Opacity Scaling**: Darkness opacity ranges from 0% (full light) to 80% (maximum darkness)
- **Torch Effects**: Localized light reduction around torch positions
- **Layer Rendering**: Darkness overlay rendered on top of all game elements
- **Performance**: Efficient calculation only for visible tiles within camera view

### **Light Level Calculation**
- **Base Light**: Environment-specific base light level
- **Torch Bonus**: Calculated from all torches within 2.5 tile radius
- **Distance Falloff**: Linear falloff from torch center to edge of light radius
- **Maximum Light**: Effective light capped at 1.0 regardless of torch density
- **Real-Time Updates**: Light levels recalculated dynamically as torches are added/removed

## üèóÔ∏è **Current Architecture & Optimization Analysis** - Updated December 2024

### **Current System Architecture Analysis**

#### **Lighting System Performance Assessment**
The current LightingSystem implementation shows several optimization opportunities:

**Current Implementation Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ **Tile-Based Darkness Rendering**: Efficient per-tile light calculation for underground areas
- ‚úÖ **Torch Position Tracking**: Map-based torch registration system for light calculations
- ‚úÖ **Environment-Aware Lighting**: Different base light levels for world/mine/dungeon
- ‚úÖ **Day/Night Cycle Integration**: Sinusoidal light progression with visual darkness overlay

**Identified Performance Bottlenecks:**
- ‚ùå **O(n¬≤) Torch Distance Calculations**: Every tile checks against ALL torches in system
- ‚ùå **Redundant Light Calculations**: Same tiles recalculated every frame without caching
- ‚ùå **Full-Screen Darkness Overlay**: Renders darkness for entire camera view, not just dark areas
- ‚ùå **Missing Spatial Indexing**: No spatial optimization for torch light radius queries

#### **Cached Tile Data Architecture Assessment**

**Current Implementation Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **Hierarchical Chunk System**: World uses 16x16 chunk-based tile management
- ‚úÖ **Modified Tile Tracking**: Chunks track only modified tiles for memory efficiency
- ‚úÖ **Visible Tile Caching**: World caches visible tiles based on camera view
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Environment Isolation**: Separate tile systems for world/dungeon/mine

**Storage Optimization Issues:**
- ‚ùå **Inconsistent Cache Invalidation**: Multiple systems invalidate cache independently
- ‚ùå **Memory Leak Potential**: No automatic cleanup of old cached data
- ‚ùå **Redundant Entity Tracking**: NPCs tracked in both chunks and separate maps
- ‚ùå **Missing Compression**: Large tile data structures stored without compression

#### **Player & NPC Update Performance Analysis**

**Current Optimization Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ **Camera-Based Updates**: Only update entities within camera view + buffer
- ‚úÖ **Two-Phase Movement**: Sophisticated movement intention system prevents deadlocks
- ‚úÖ **Distance-Squared Calculations**: Avoids expensive sqrt() calls for distance checks
- ‚úÖ **Cached Nearby Entities**: Pre-calculates nearby NPCs/buildings for each update cycle

**Performance Bottlenecks Identified:**
- ‚ùå **Nested Loop Updates**: O(n¬≤) complexity for NPC-to-NPC interactions
- ‚ùå **Redundant Pathfinding**: NPCs recalculate paths every frame without caching
- ‚ùå **Synchronous Updates**: All NPCs updated in single thread, blocking rendering
- ‚ùå **Missing Entity Pooling**: NPCs created/destroyed frequently causing GC pressure

### **Atomic OOP Principles Implementation Status**

#### **Current Architecture Compliance**

**‚úÖ Well-Implemented Principles:**
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Most systems have focused responsibilities
   - `LightingSystem`: Handles only lighting calculations and rendering
   - `InputSystem`: Centralized input processing with action queue architecture
   - `ActionSystem`: Atomic action processing with proper error handling
   - `AnimationSystem`: Centralized entity animation management

2. **Dependency Injection**: Some systems use constructor injection
   - `World` receives `Camera` and `WorldGenerator` dependencies
   - `Movement` system receives `World`, `Dungeon`, `Mine`, and `Camera`
   - `UIManager` receives canvas context dependency

3. **Interface Segregation**: Well-defined interfaces for different entity types
   - `AnimatedEntity`, `POILike`, `NPCLike`, `TreeLike`, `CactusLike` interfaces
   - Separate interfaces for different structure types (VillageStructure, MineStructure, DungeonStructure)

**‚ùå Areas Needing Improvement:**

1. **Tight Coupling Issues:**
   ```typescript
   // Game.ts - Direct dependencies create tight coupling
   this.world = new World(this.camera, new WorldGenerator(seed));
   this.dungeon = new Dungeon(seed);
   this.mine = new Mine(seed);
   ```

2. **Mixed Responsibilities:**
   ```typescript
   // World.ts - Handles both tile management AND NPC updates
   private updateVillageStructures(deltaTime: number, playerPosition?: Position, playerInventory?: InventoryItem[]): void
   ```

3. **Missing Abstractions:**
   - No common interface for World/Dungeon/Mine tile providers
   - Direct method calls between systems instead of event-driven communication
   - No service locator pattern for global system access

### **Recommended Optimization Strategies**

#### **1. Lighting System Optimizations**

**Spatial Indexing for Torch Queries:**
```typescript
class SpatialLightingSystem extends LightingSystem {
  private torchQuadTree: QuadTree<TorchData>;
  private lightCache = new Map<string, number>(); // tileKey -> effectiveLight
  private cacheValidUntil = 0;

  public calculateEffectiveLightLevel(tile: Tile, renderingMode: string): number {
    const tileKey = `${tile.x},${tile.y}`;
    const now = Date.now();

    // Use cached value if still valid (cache for 100ms)
    if (now < this.cacheValidUntil && this.lightCache.has(tileKey)) {
      return this.lightCache.get(tileKey)!;
    }

    // Query only nearby torches using spatial indexing
    const nearbyTorches = this.torchQuadTree.queryRange(tile.x - 3, tile.y - 3, 6, 6);
    const lightLevel = this.calculateLightFromTorches(tile, nearbyTorches, renderingMode);

    this.lightCache.set(tileKey, lightLevel);
    return lightLevel;
  }
}
```

**Optimized Darkness Rendering:**
```typescript
// Only render darkness for tiles that actually need it
private renderOptimizedDarkness(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D, camera: Camera): void {
  const darkTiles = this.identifyDarkTiles(camera); // Pre-filter dark tiles

  for (const darkTile of darkTiles) {
    const opacity = this.calculateDarknessOpacity(darkTile);
    if (opacity > 0.05) { // Skip nearly transparent tiles
      this.renderTileDarkness(ctx, darkTile, opacity);
    }
  }
}
```

#### **2. Enhanced Cached Tile Data Architecture**

**Unified Cache Manager:**
```typescript
interface TileProvider {
  getTile(x: number, y: number): Tile | null;
  setTile(x: number, y: number, tile: Tile): void;
  invalidateRegion(x: number, y: number, width: number, height: number): void;
}

class UnifiedCacheManager {
  private providers = new Map<string, TileProvider>();
  private cacheMetrics = new Map<string, CacheMetrics>();

  public registerProvider(name: string, provider: TileProvider): void {
    this.providers.set(name, provider);
    this.cacheMetrics.set(name, new CacheMetrics());
  }

  public getTile(providerName: string, x: number, y: number): Tile | null {
    const provider = this.providers.get(providerName);
    const metrics = this.cacheMetrics.get(providerName);

    if (provider && metrics) {
      metrics.recordAccess();
      return provider.getTile(x, y);
    }
    return null;
  }

  // Automatic cleanup based on access patterns
  public performMaintenance(): void {
    for (const [name, metrics] of this.cacheMetrics) {
      if (metrics.shouldCleanup()) {
        this.providers.get(name)?.invalidateRegion(/* unused areas */);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Compressed Tile Storage:**
```typescript
interface CompressedTileData {
  baseType: TileType;
  modifications: Uint8Array; // Compressed delta from base
  entityFlags: number; // Bitfield for entity presence
}

class CompressedChunk extends Chunk {
  private compressedData = new Map<string, CompressedTileData>();

  public compressTile(tile: Tile): CompressedTileData {
    return {
      baseType: tile.value,
      modifications: this.compressTileModifications(tile),
      entityFlags: this.encodeEntityFlags(tile)
    };
  }

  public decompressTile(data: CompressedTileData, x: number, y: number): Tile {
    const baseTile = this.generateBaseTile(data.baseType, x, y);
    this.applyModifications(baseTile, data.modifications);
    this.restoreEntities(baseTile, data.entityFlags);
    return baseTile;
  }
}
```

#### **3. Atomic OOP Architecture Improvements**

**Service Locator Pattern Implementation:**
```typescript
interface GameService {
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
  update(deltaTime: number): void;
  cleanup(): void;
}

class ServiceLocator {
  private static services = new Map<string, GameService>();
  private static instances = new Map<string, any>();

  public static register<T extends GameService>(name: string, serviceClass: new(...args: any[]) => T): void {
    this.services.set(name, serviceClass as any);
  }

  public static async get<T>(name: string): Promise<T> {
    if (!this.instances.has(name)) {
      const ServiceClass = this.services.get(name);
      if (ServiceClass) {
        const instance = new (ServiceClass as any)();
        await instance.initialize();
        this.instances.set(name, instance);
      }
    }
    return this.instances.get(name) as T;
  }

  public static async initializeAll(): Promise<void> {
    const initPromises = Array.from(this.instances.values()).map(service => service.initialize());
    await Promise.all(initPromises);
  }
}

// Usage:
ServiceLocator.register('lightingSystem', LightingSystem);
ServiceLocator.register('worldGenerator', WorldGenerator);
const lighting = await ServiceLocator.get<LightingSystem>('lightingSystem');
```

**Event-Driven Communication System:**
```typescript
interface GameEvent {
  type: string;
  timestamp: number;
  data?: any;
  source?: string;
}

class EventBus implements GameService {
  private listeners = new Map<string, Set<(event: GameEvent) => void>>();
  private eventQueue: GameEvent[] = [];

  public subscribe(eventType: string, callback: (event: GameEvent) => void): void {
    if (!this.listeners.has(eventType)) {
      this.listeners.set(eventType, new Set());
    }
    this.listeners.get(eventType)!.add(callback);
  }

  public emit(event: GameEvent): void {
    this.eventQueue.push({ ...event, timestamp: Date.now() });
  }

  public update(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Process events in batches to prevent frame drops
    const batchSize = 10;
    const eventsToProcess = this.eventQueue.splice(0, batchSize);

    for (const event of eventsToProcess) {
      const listeners = this.listeners.get(event.type);
      if (listeners) {
        for (const callback of listeners) {
          try {
            callback(event);
          } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Error processing event ${event.type}:`, error);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

// Usage:
eventBus.subscribe('player.moved', (event) => {
  lightingSystem.updatePlayerLighting(event.data.position);
});

eventBus.subscribe('npc.died', (event) => {
  world.createTombstone(event.data.npc, event.data.position);
});
```

**Entity Component System (ECS) Foundation:**
```typescript
interface Component {
  readonly type: string;
}

interface PositionComponent extends Component {
  type: 'position';
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

interface HealthComponent extends Component {
  type: 'health';
  current: number;
  maximum: number;
}

interface RenderComponent extends Component {
  type: 'render';
  sprite: Sprite;
  layer: number;
}

class Entity {
  private static nextId = 0;
  public readonly id: number;
  private components = new Map<string, Component>();

  constructor() {
    this.id = Entity.nextId++;
  }

  public addComponent<T extends Component>(component: T): void {
    this.components.set(component.type, component);
  }

  public getComponent<T extends Component>(type: string): T | null {
    return (this.components.get(type) as T) || null;
  }

  public hasComponent(type: string): boolean {
    return this.components.has(type);
  }
}

abstract class System implements GameService {
  protected entities = new Set<Entity>();
  protected requiredComponents: string[] = [];

  public addEntity(entity: Entity): void {
    if (this.canProcessEntity(entity)) {
      this.entities.add(entity);
    }
  }

  private canProcessEntity(entity: Entity): boolean {
    return this.requiredComponents.every(type => entity.hasComponent(type));
  }

  public abstract update(deltaTime: number): void;
}

class MovementSystem extends System {
  protected requiredComponents = ['position', 'movement'];

  public update(deltaTime: number): void {
    for (const entity of this.entities) {
      const position = entity.getComponent<PositionComponent>('position');
      const movement = entity.getComponent<MovementComponent>('movement');

      if (position && movement) {
        this.updateEntityMovement(entity, position, movement, deltaTime);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### **4. Performance Optimization Implementation**

**Asynchronous NPC Updates:**
```typescript
class AsyncNPCUpdateSystem {
  private updateWorker: Worker;
  private pendingUpdates = new Map<number, NPCUpdateData>();

  constructor() {
    this.updateWorker = new Worker('/workers/npc-update-worker.js');
    this.updateWorker.onmessage = this.handleWorkerResponse.bind(this);
  }

  public async updateNPCs(npcs: NPC[], context: UpdateContext): Promise<void> {
    // Batch NPCs into chunks for parallel processing
    const chunks = this.chunkArray(npcs, 10);
    const updatePromises = chunks.map(chunk => this.updateNPCChunk(chunk, context));

    await Promise.all(updatePromises);
  }

  private async updateNPCChunk(npcs: NPC[], context: UpdateContext): Promise<void> {
    const updateData = npcs.map(npc => this.serializeNPCForUpdate(npc, context));

    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      const requestId = Math.random();
      this.pendingUpdates.set(requestId, { resolve, npcs });

      this.updateWorker.postMessage({
        type: 'updateNPCs',
        requestId,
        data: updateData,
        context
      });
    });
  }
}
```

**Object Pooling for Frequent Allocations:**
```typescript
class EntityPool<T> {
  private available: T[] = [];
  private inUse = new Set<T>();
  private factory: () => T;
  private resetFn: (item: T) => void;

  constructor(factory: () => T, resetFn: (item: T) => void, preAllocate = 10) {
    this.factory = factory;
    this.resetFn = resetFn;

    // Pre-allocate objects to avoid GC pressure
    for (let i = 0; i < preAllocate; i++) {
      this.available.push(factory());
    }
  }

  public acquire(): T {
    let item = this.available.pop();
    if (!item) {
      item = this.factory();
    }

    this.inUse.add(item);
    return item;
  }

  public release(item: T): void {
    if (this.inUse.has(item)) {
      this.inUse.delete(item);
      this.resetFn(item);
      this.available.push(item);
    }
  }

  public getStats(): { available: number; inUse: number } {
    return {
      available: this.available.length,
      inUse: this.inUse.size
    };
  }
}

// Usage:
const npcPool = new EntityPool(
  () => new NPC({ type: 'chicken', position: { x: 0, y: 0 } }),
  (npc) => npc.reset(),
  50 // Pre-allocate 50 NPCs
);

const newNPC = npcPool.acquire();
// Use NPC...
npcPool.release(newNPC);
```

### **Implementation Priority Recommendations**

#### **Phase 1: Critical Performance (Immediate)**
1. **Spatial Indexing for Lighting** - Reduce O(n¬≤) torch calculations to O(log n)
2. **NPC Update Batching** - Group NPC updates to prevent frame drops
3. **Cache Invalidation Optimization** - Reduce redundant cache rebuilding
4. **Object Pooling** - Implement for NPCs and frequently created entities

#### **Phase 2: Architecture Improvements (Medium Term)**
1. **Service Locator Pattern** - Reduce tight coupling between systems
2. **Event-Driven Communication** - Replace direct method calls with events
3. **Unified Cache Manager** - Centralize all tile caching logic
4. **Compressed Tile Storage** - Reduce memory usage for large worlds

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Long Term)**
1. **Full ECS Implementation** - Migrate from inheritance to composition
2. **Asynchronous Systems** - Move heavy calculations to web workers
3. **Predictive Caching** - Pre-load tiles based on player movement patterns
4. **Dynamic Level of Detail** - Reduce update frequency for distant entities

### **Performance Monitoring & Metrics**

```typescript
class PerformanceMonitor {
  private metrics = new Map<string, PerformanceMetric>();

  public startTiming(name: string): void {
    this.metrics.set(name, { startTime: performance.now() });
  }

  public endTiming(name: string): number {
    const metric = this.metrics.get(name);
    if (metric) {
      const duration = performance.now() - metric.startTime;
      metric.totalTime = (metric.totalTime || 0) + duration;
      metric.callCount = (metric.callCount || 0) + 1;
      return duration;
    }
    return 0;
  }

  public getAverageTime(name: string): number {
    const metric = this.metrics.get(name);
    return metric && metric.callCount ? metric.totalTime / metric.callCount : 0;
  }

  public logPerformanceReport(): void {
    console.table(
      Array.from(this.metrics.entries()).map(([name, metric]) => ({
        System: name,
        'Avg Time (ms)': this.getAverageTime(name).toFixed(2),
        'Total Calls': metric.callCount || 0,
        'Total Time (ms)': (metric.totalTime || 0).toFixed(2)
      }))
    );
  }
}
```

This comprehensive optimization strategy addresses the current performance bottlenecks while establishing a foundation for scalable, maintainable code architecture following atomic OOP principles.

## üë§ **Player System**

### **Player Name & Identity**
- **URL Parameter Support**: Player name can be set via `playerName` URL parameter (e.g., `?playerName=Hero`)
- **Default Name**: Players start with default name "Hero" if no URL parameter provided
- **Name Display**: Player name shown in inventory UI and tombstone titles
- **Character Limit**: Player names limited to 20 characters with alphanumeric characters, spaces, hyphens, and underscores
- **Persistent Identity**: Player name used in tombstone creation across all environments

### **Player Inventory System**
- **Dual Layout**: Inventory UI shows player items (left) and character view with armor slots (right)
- **Player Name Display**: Shows "Player: [Name]" at top of character section
- **Full-Width Interface**: Uses entire canvas width when open
- **Navigation**: Arrow keys move between inventory grid (0-8) and armor slots (9-15)
- **Armor Organization**:
  - **Column 1**: Head, Torso, Legs, Feet (slots 9-12)
  - **Column 2**: Left Hand, Right Hand/Arms, Wearable (slots 13-15)
